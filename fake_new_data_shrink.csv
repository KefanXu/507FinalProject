It's probably well known already, just thought I'd post it just in case. Podesta had forwarded this letter he received onto Leslie Kean. Date: 2015-03-06 John – Just tuck this in your UFO files for future reference. One of the government programs that collects hard data on unidentified flying objects is the USAF DSP satellite program. I can add a little insight to rumors published on the web. While I was never fully briefed into the DSP operation directly, I was introduced to them as the US prepared for Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On occasion, I had lunch with a few of them in the cafeteria of a highly classified organization in El Segundo, CA. No one could get into the cafeteria without TS/SCI clearances, so this was not “lightweight group of gossipers.” One of these times, a member of that group was really excited – said they’d just picked up Fastwalker (I assumed that same day). He described how it entered our atmosphere from “deep space” (origin actually unknown, of course, but from the backside of the satellite) and zipped by the DSP satellite pretty closely on its way to earth. Not only was it going very fast but it made a 30 degree course correction (turn) which means it did not have a ballistic (free fall) reentry trajectory that a meteorite might have. So, it was under some sort of control – although whether it was “manned” or just “robotic” there’s no way to tell. Although its now 24 years later, one factoid makes me think the USAF is still collecting information on these Fastwalkers. Reading the current official USAF “DSP Fact Sheet” there is this line near the end: In addition, researchers at The Aerospace Corporation have used DSP to develop portions of a hazard support system that will aid public safety in the future. www.losangeles.af.mil... Also, much of the information on this site is accurate although I do not know the author or his sources: ufodigest.com... Somewhere within that USAF program office is many year’s worth of Fastwalker data. If someone were to collect and analyze it, patterns will emerge that provide information about the various types of craft and their destinations, which would add substantiation to eyewitness claims on the ground about UFO activity. Furthermore, it would be interesting to understand the dates of these appearances – is there a certain time of the every year they swarm in (which might indicate a resource mining operation) or might there be a correlation with major events on earth, (such as the detonation of the first atomic bomb at White Sands in 1945 although no DSP’s existed to provide any info on that particular event)?

New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants. 
As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties. 
In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him “I don’t rent to the n-word,” and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy. 
The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump’s run-in with the federal government over discrimination. 
Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing. The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties. 
One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a “C” on the documents for “colored,” and that was a sign that they should be denied. 
The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump’s involvement with his father’s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father’s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business. But if you accept that, the Trump Organization’s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away – it’s still there.

Newly released emails from Wikileaks show Hillary Clinton staffers debating how they can best use the death of a black man to further their agenda. 
The email began as a request for an essay by Clinton from Marie Claire who was partnering with Harvard University on a study about women and guns but it quickly devolved into brainstorming ideas on how to push the campaign’s anti-gun and racial narratives. 
The team began discussing an article published in “The Guardian” where the mother of Jordan Davis, a black teenager murdered by a white man for playing music loud, called the killing a “legal lynching” despite the fact that the murderer, Michael David Dunn, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. 
De’Ara Balenger, the director of engagement for “Hillary for America” could hardly contain her excitement. 
“This is great,” she wrote. “The only flag here is that Jordan Davis was killed by a white man, so arguably – this crime was racially motivated, which takes this outside the discussion of gun violence.

Reviewing the work of the influential theorist James Burnham, Orwell presaged several concepts that would later form the groundwork for his best-known novel, 1984.
“Not only is the best of capitalism behind us, but the worst of it may lie just ahead.”
In his book The Managerial Revolution , Burnham envisioned, as Orwell put it , “a new kind of planned, centralised society which will be neither capitalist nor, in any accepted sense of the word, democratic. The rulers of this new society will be the people who effectively control the means of production.”
“The real question,” Orwell adds, “is not whether the people who wipe their boots on us during the next fifty years are to be called managers, bureaucrats, or politicians: the question is whether capitalism, now obviously doomed, is to give way to oligarchy or to true democracy.”
While Orwell was wary of Burnham’s worldview and of his more specific predictions, he agreed that the relationship between capitalism and democracy has always been, and always will be, a precarious one.
“For quite fifty years past,” Orwell noted, “the general drift has almost certainly been towards oligarchy.”
Pointing to the concentration of political and economic power in the hands of the few and acknowledging “the weakness of the proletariat against the centralised state,” Orwell was far from optimistic about the future — but he was quite certain that the economic status quo would eventually give way.
Recent events, and the material circumstances of much of the world’s population, have prompted serious examinations of the same questions Orwell was considering seven decades ago. And though it appears as if rumors of capitalism’s imminent demise have been greatly exaggerated, there is good reason to believe that its remarkable ability to adapt and evolve in the face of frequent (self-induced) shocks has reached a breaking point.
Widespread discontent over stagnant incomes and the uneven prosperity brought about by neoliberal globalization has, in 2016, come to a head in striking fashion; Donald Trump, Brexit, and the rise of far-right parties in Europe have many questioning previously sacred assumptions.
“Is the marriage between liberal democracy and global capitalism an enduring one?” asked Martin Wolf, a formidable commentator in one of the world’s leading business papers, the Financial Times .
This was no rhetorical softball; Wolf is genuinely concerned that the winners of globalization have grown complacent, that they have “taken for granted” a couple that was only tenuously compatible to begin with. He also worries, rightly, that they have downplayed the concerns of the “losers.”
Wolf concludes that “if the legitimacy of our democratic political systems is to be maintained, economic policy must be orientated towards promoting the interests of the many not the few; in the first place would be the citizenry, to whom the politicians are accountable.”
Not all members of the commentariat share Wolf’s willingness to engage with these cherished assumptions, however. Indeed, many analysts have reserved their ire not for failing institutions or policies but for the public, reviving Walter Lippmann’s characterization of the masses as a “bewildered herd” that, if left to its own devices, is sure to usher in a regime of chaos.
“It’s time,” declared Foreign Policy ‘s James Traub, channeling the sentiments of Josh Barro, “for the elites to rise up against the ignorant masses.”
Apologists like Traub and Barro — just two among many — speak and write as if the leash previously restraining the “herd” has been loosened, and that the resulting freedom has laid bare what elitists have long believed to be the case: To use Barro’s infamous words , “Elites are usually elite for good reason, and tend to have better judgment than the average person.” They point to the rise of Donald Trump as evidence of an intolerable democratic surplus — evidence, in short, of what the masses will do if granted a loud enough voice.
Aside from being conveniently self-serving, this narrative is also false.
Far from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions. The resulting concentration of wealth and political power is jarring, and it puts the lie to the farcical notion that elites are a persecuted minority.
But, in the midst of these anti-democratic diatribes, fascinating and important critiques of a rather different nature have emerged.
“Far from loosening the leash, elites have consolidated power to an unprecedented extent , and they have used their influence to undercut democratic movements and hijack public institutions.”
Instead of urging us to align Against Democracy , to use the name of a recent book by the libertarian political philosopher Jason Brennan, many are arguing that it is capitalism, and not the excesses of the democratic process, that has provided figures like Trump a launching pad.
In his book Postcapitalism , Paul Mason argues that the rapid emergence of information technology has corroded the boundaries of the market; “capitalism,” he insists, “has reached the limits of its capacity to adapt.” And its attempts to reach beyond these limits have fostered an economic environment defined by instability, crippling austerity for the many, and rapid accumulation of wealth for the few.
According to Oxfam, the global 1 percent now owns as much wealth as the bottom 99 percent. CEO pay has continued to soar. And though post-crisis reforms have carried soaring promises of stability, the financial sector is still far too large , and many of the banks harmed by the crash they created are back and nearly as powerful as ever .",english,2016-10-27T07:58:28.423+03:00,anonhq.com,US,12993,"Capitalism Is Doomed — Without Alternatives, So Are We",0.009,http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/enjoy_capitalism.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs

The most interesting of the emails in this batch involves a message from John Podesta to Obama regarding an invitation from President George W. Bush to then ‘President-Elect’. It alluded to a transition plan that was being worked on before the election took place.
According to the memo, Obama was already discussing his transition into office with the then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Here is a statement taken from a memo sent from the transition board to Barack Obama:
As you have observed in your interactions with Secretary Paulson, he is apparently eager to involve you and your transition team extensively in his policy choices following the election.
Immediately after the election Secretary Paulson and other members of the Administration will likely seek to involve you and your transition team in their ongoing policy responses to the financial and housing crises. We also expect relentless interest from the press and public about your intended level of engagement with the Administration on these matters during the transition.
Think about this for a second, Obama’s transition was already being discussed with certain members of the Bush administration. Also, judging by the email, it’s clear that it was known that Obama was going to be the president.
Another telling email, dated October 30, 2008, came from John Podesta to the then Senator Obama discussing an economic transition team, and why Obama needed to get the wheels in motion before his term begins.",english,2016-10-27T07:59:43.641+03:00,anonhq.com,US,12993,Wikileaks Releases First Batch Of Barack Obama Emails & They Hint At A Rigged Election,0,http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/barackobama.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

“The United States has the power to decree the death of nations,” wrote Stephen Kinzer in the Boston Globe.
Kinzer’s article was entitled: “ The media are misleading the public on Syria .” In his piece, the scholar at a Brown University Institute contested that his country’s media misinformation on Syria is leading to the kind of ignorance which is enabling the American government to pursue any policy, however imprudent, in the war-torn Arab country.
The US government can ‘decree the death of nations’ with “popular support because many Americans — and many journalists — are content with the official story,” he wrote.
Kinzer, in principle makes a strong point. His article, however, was particularly popular among those who sees the Syrian government entirely innocent of any culpability in the ongoing war, and that Iran and Russia are at no fault whatsoever; better yet, their intervention in Syria is entirely morally-guided and altruistic.
That said, Kinzer’s assertion regarding the US government’s dangerous meddling in Syria’s affairs, renewed Cold War with Russia and ill-defined military mission in that country, is all true.
Neither is the US, nor its western and other allies, following rules of war nor adhering to a particularly noble set of principles aimed at ending that most devastating war, which has killed well over 300,000 people , rendered millions displaced and destroyed the country’s wealth and infrastructure.
So what is the truth on Syria?
In the last five and a half years, since a regional uprising turned into an armed rebellion—turned into civil, regional and international war—’the truth on Syria’, has been segmented into many self-tailored ‘truths,’ each promoted by one of the warring party to be the one and only, absolute and uncontested reality. But since there are many parties to the conflict, the versions of the ‘truth’ communicated to us via copious media, are numerous and, most often, unverifiable.
The only truth that all parties seem to agree upon is that hundreds of thousands are dead and Syria is shattered. But, of course, each points to the other side for culpability of the ongoing genocide.
An oddly refreshing, although disturbing ‘truth’ was articulated by Alon Ben-David in the Israeli Jerusalem Post last year.
The title of his article speaks volumes: “ May it never end: The uncomfortable truth about the war in Syria .”
“If Israel’s interest in the war in Syria can be summarized in brief, it would be: That it should never end,” Ben-David wrote.
“No one will say this publicly, but the continuation of the fighting in Syria, as long as there is a recognized authority in Damascus, allows Israel to stay out of the swamp and distance itself from the swarms of mosquitoes that are buzzing in it.” Of course, Israel never truly ‘stayed out of the swamp’ , but that is for a separate discussion.",english,2016-10-27T08:01:08.762+03:00,anonhq.com,US,12993,The Many "Truths" on Syria: How Our Rivalry Has Destroyed a Country,0,http://anonhq.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/truth_in_syria.jpg,0,1,416,0,416,bs

Podesta and Kadzik, the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs, were in frequent contact, other emails show. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — More than 100 of Hillary Clinton’s biggest donors crowded into the home of Casey and Laura Wasserman here on Thursday night, each having written a check for at least $33,400 to snag a ticket. The Hollywood glitterati in attendance — Elton John performed on the piano; Barbra Streisand mingled in the crowd — were sending her off for the home stretch of the campaign with north of $5 million in fresh funding. 
It was a fitting capstone to a remarkable 18 months for Clinton on the lucrative California fundraising circuit, this final event anchored by a host committee of billionaires, Hollywood executives, media moguls and tech investors — Sean Parker, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Haim Saban, Chris Sacca — that each directed $416,000 to Clinton’s efforts. 
Clinton calls them her “Hillblazers,” campaign bundlers who have given or raised at least $100,000 for her campaign. And she has erected an unparalleled and unprecedented infrastructure of 1,133 such people — nearly double the number of any past presidential candidate, including President Obama four years ago. 
While Clinton and her advisers like to tout her small online donors, it is these bundlers in more than 40 states and four foreign countries who form the true backbone of her financial operation. Combined, this elite $100,000-and-up club has amassed a minimum of $113 million for Clinton and the Democratic Party — and the actual figure is likely far, far higher than that. (The biggest bundlers typically collect millions for campaigns.) 
“We had the best base of donors and bundlers and raisers ever in 2008. It was even better in 2012. And it’s much better in 2016 than 2012,” said Wade Randlett, a San Francisco-based Democrat who has raised money for Clinton, Obama and Democratic causes for decades. “The Obama people basically 100 percent in are favor of Hillary. There’s really no loss because of ideology or bad blood. And she has added an enormous number of people, especially women.” 
Among her bundlers are celebrities (Will Smith) and sports stars (Earvin “Magic” Johnson), Hollywood directors (Steven Spielberg and George Lucas) and corporate executives (Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg), Wall Street-types (Marc Lasry), media executives (Haim Saban and Anna Wintour) and members of Congress, including her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine, who helped raise more than $100,000 for Clinton before he joined the ticket in July. 
The Clinton campaign said 45 percent of its bundlers are women. 
There are also federal lobbyists, from whom the Democratic Party under Obama refused to accept money, a prohibition that has since been rolled back. 
This club has expanded to the point where Clinton would now struggle to fit all of these bundlers into a single ballroom. As of the end of June, she counted 496 such individuals and couples. By the end of July, it was 871. On August 31, it was 1,133. 
It includes billionaires George Soros, Warren Buffett and Tom Steyer, super lobbyists like Steve Elmendorf and bold-faced names like Calvin Klein and J.J. Abrams. There is also a sprinkling of longtime Clinton family advisers, such as Vernon Jordan.",english,2016-10-27T00:19:57.290+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Hillary has built the biggest big-money operation ever,0,http://awdnews.com/images/14774971911.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy

In an email released by Wikileaks, top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin seemed to express concern for the health of her boss. 
“She’s going to stick to notes a little closer this am, still not perfect in her head,” Abedin told Podesta and others in a discussion on messaging to reporters about a Jeb Bush Super PAC. 
It appears that Abedin wasn’t the only person concerned about Hillary’s health. 
In an email dated September 26, 2015, John Podesta asked Jennifer Palmieri, “How bad is her head?” 
Palmieri responded, “Don’t know.” 
A post at Heat Street observed: 
Hillary Clinton suffered a “cracked head” (her words) after suffering a fall in December 2012. Many have speculated about her health since that episode, and questions grew louder in September of this year when Hillary was caught on tape nearly collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event in Manhattan. 
After initially blaming the health scare on “dehydration,” the campaign was forced to acknowledge the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia. 
“It was unclear whether Abedin was referring to a serious ailment,” the New York Post added. 
In January 2016, Breitbart reported: 
Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s disappearance from the debate stage last month left people speculating that the former First Lady took a long bathroom break, but now a law-enforcement source with inside connections is alleging that Clinton was missing from the stage due to health issues stemming from a previous brain injury. 
These long-lasting symptoms stemming from a concussion and blood clot, according to a neurologist, suggest Clinton is suffering from post-concussion syndrome, which can severely impact her cognitive abilities.

Donald Trump’s campaign has ended fundraising events meant to support the Republican Party’s get-out-the-vote efforts in next month’s elections. 
Aides to the Republican nominee told Fox News that Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee for the GOP and the campaign, held its most recent fundraiser on Oct. 19 and no more such events were scheduled. 
The move, which was first reported by The Washington Post, cuts off a key money source for Republicans hoping to keep hold of both houses of Congress. 
“We’ve kind of wound down,” Trump national finance chairman Steven Mnuchin told the Post. “But the online fundraising continues to be strong.” 
By contrast, the Post reported that Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign has scheduled 41 fundraising events between now and Nov. 4. The former secretary of state was scheduled to make her last personal fundraising appearance Tuesday in Miami. 
Mnuchin told the paper that the real estate mogul was focusing on making his final pitch to the voters at a campaign events rather than raising money in the final two weeks of the race. 
“We have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],” Mnuchin said of the candidate. “Unlike Hillary, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.” 
According to the Post, the Republican National Committee had collected $40 million through Trump Victory as of Sept. 30. 
RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the organization “[continues] to fundraise for the entire GOP ticket.”

Hillary Clinton personally ordered a consultant to use a nonprofit group to troll the Trump campaign with a ‘Donald Duck’ mascot, according to the Democratic operatives who say they arranged it with a nonprofit organization. 
When Breitbart News’ Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, confronted Mook about Creamer and his firm in the spin room after the third presidential debate, Mook claimed: “They’ve never worked for our campaign.” When asked if Clinton had ever discussed the controversial political operations with Creamer directly, Mook replied: “I don’t think so.” 
Now, however, O’Keefe and Project Veritas have released video of Creamer claiming that Clinton directly approved one of his more bizarre plans — an effort to attract media attention and incite violence by dressing an activist in a Donald Duck costume and sending that activist into Trump events, emphasizing the argument that Trump was “ducking” releasing his tax returns. 
The action, if true, would be a black-letter violation of federal election law, which prohibits presidential campaigns from coordinating activities with outside groups that can collect unlimited ‘dark money’ from contributors – and don’t pay taxes on what they collect. 
Project Veritas Action video footage shows Robert Creamer, a convicted felon who was forced out of his executive role at the liberal consultancy Democracy Partners, saying Clinton chose the duck stunt.

Men back Trump over Clinton 48 percent to 34 percent, with women supporting Clinton 46 percent to 38 percent. 
Whites back Trump over Clinton, 50 percent to 33 percent. White men back Trump, 55 percent to 27 percent and a majority of white women also support Trump over Clinton, 46 percent to 39 percent. 
Fifteen percent of blacks and Hispanics back Trump over Clinton, while she earns 65 percent of those blocs’ support. Broken down, 11 percent of blacks support Trump, and 22 percent of Hispanics support him. 
Taking a look at income, likely voters making $50,000 or less each year favor Trump, while those making more than $75,000 a year favor Clinton. Of those earning between $50,000 and $75,000, 43 percent support Clinton, while 41 percent support Trump – a statistical tie. 
Among independents, Trump leads Clinton 44 percent to 31 percent. Among Republicans, Trump gets 84 percent support, with eight percent backing Clinton. This while only 77 percent of Democrats support Clinton, with nine percent saying they plan to vote Trump.

Do not let their cooperation continue, because it is going to end up bad for America. Lets choose a true patriot and see where would our country go! I am sure it is going to be much better than crooked Hillary’s road. 
Turki al-Faisal, who served as Saudia Arabia’s ambassador to the US from 2005 to 2007, spoke against the presumptive Republican nominee during a foreign policy dinner in Washington, DC on Thursday. 
He blasted Trump’s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, which the billionaire first formulated in December last year before renewing his vow on Wednesday. 
‘For the life of me, I cannot believe that a country like the United States can afford to have someone as president who simply says, “These people are not going to be allowed to come to the United States,”’ Turki said according to the Huffington Post. 
‘It’s up to you, it’s not up to me,’ Turki added. ‘I just hope you, as American citizens, will make the right choice in November.’ 
The gulf nations represent three of the largest donors to the foundation, but that is hardly the extent of their ties to the Clintons. Qatari, UAE, and Saudi firms paid Bill Clinton millions of dollars for speeches during the time Hillary served as secretary of state, when she also approved weapons deals with all three countries worth billions of dollars to U.S. defense firms, many of which are also Clinton Foundation donors. 
Bill Clinton has praised the Qataris as “intelligent, forward looking” investment partners for their collaboration on Clinton Foundation projects. One of Hillary’s top advisers, Cheryl Mills, served on the board of the New York 
University campus in Abu Dhabi. Bill Clinton is the friend and former classmate of Saudi Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, who recently attended a lavish Clinton Foundation conference in Marrakech, hosted by the King of Morocco. The Bill Clinton presidential library in Little Rock was funded in part by a $10 million from the Saudi Royal family. 
Turk, who went to Georgetown University in Washington, DC, isn’t currently part of Saudia Arabia’s government but serves as the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, a cultural organization that conducts research in politics, sociology and heritage.",english,2016-10-27T00:19:59.268+03:00,awdnews.com,DE,,Arab Prince Who Gave Hillary $50 Million Begs Americans Not to Vote for Trump,0,http://awdnews.com/images/14774946001.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,conspiracy

The UK's Liberal Democrats revealed that the British government is providing the training in both Saudi Arabia and Britain itself, The Independent revealed on Saturday. The party’s Foreign Affairs spokesman, Tom Brake, obtained a parliamentary letter from UK Defense Secretary Michael Fallon, in which he acknowledged that the British government provides the training to Saudi pilots bombing civilians in Yemen. Brake denounced the move as “shameful,” calling on the Ministry of Defense to end the training immediately. “The Government must end its complicity in this murderous campaign,” he said. ""It is shameful that the UK government is not only arming Saudi pilots, it is training them as well.” Saudi Arabia has launched a war in Yemen on March 26, 2015, in a bid to undermine the HouthiAnsarullah movement and restore power to Saudi-backed former president AbdRabbuh Mansur Hadi. Since the beginning of the aggression, almost 10,000 people, including over 2,000 children, have been killed. The Liberal Democrats also wanted to know what the instructions and advice had been given by the British government on authorizing military operations and the “targeting of aerial operations” over the last year. ""The indiscriminate bombing of innocent civilians by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, in clear breach of international humanitarian law, is now well documented,” Blake added. In response, Fallon claimed the government helps the Saudi Air Force in order to “improve their targeting processes and to support International Humanitarian Law (IHL) compliance.” Fallon said the UK had delivered two training sessions in Saudi Arabia on the process for investigating alleged International Humanitarian Law violations, under a joint incident team it supported. He, however, said that the government “has not provided any specific operational advice to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for operations in Yemen and has not provided training on political authorization of military operations.” The Liberal Democrat party also insisted that the latest revelation requires an urgent action by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Jonson, who personally signs off any arms sales to countries such as Saudi Arabia. London, which has been one of the biggest suppliers of weapons to Riyadh for 40 years, has come under fire for its continued sales of weapons to the kingdom during its war on Yemen. Charity group Oxfam accused the British government of being in a state of “denial and disarray” over its arms supplies to Riyadh.

An absolutely must-see! This is something that the FDA and government organizations does not want you to know about. This new scientific breakthrough has been proven to healall sorts of diseases and ailments, including ones that have been deemed ‘incurable’. The results and success stories are out of this world.
Our government wants to keep you sick so that you are dependent upon medication after medication, which just makes you sicker.
Check out this feature video. I have been on it now for less than one week and am already noticing a huge difference. I’ve also only been taking small doses as opposed to the full dose to start out with. But, if small doses is making changes in me, I can only imagine what will happen when I start taking the full amount. I am literally excited!

After being sick for many years with ‘strange’ allergies, which all began after living in a home with a hidden mold problem, I can’t tell you how thankful I am and what a blessing it is that God has led me to Glen, the gentleman in the video. It is wonderful beyond words to actually feel ‘normal’ again after having felt sick, tired, and practically living in a prison to my allergies for many years now.
For many years now, I have lived with allergies so bad, not only did I feel like I had a cold 24-7, but I had other strange symptoms too:
—extreme fatigue
—sudden visual disturbances or double vision
—dizziness
—light headedness
—problems hearing, ringing in the ears
—swelling in my face
—swollen glands
—constant food allergies
—allergies to just about everything, including smells
—just an overall not feeling right, you can’t really put your finger on it, but you just don’t feel good
—constant excessively low BP and feeling as if I am about to pass out at times
—feeling like I am in a fog
—unmovitvated
—not feeling good when I would wake up in the morning, like a person having a massive hangover
There is so much more… but I have literally lived this way since around 2004 until now, and this is the first thing that has really helped to make a difference. I will keep everyone updated, as I have not yet tried the full dose. But so far, the low dose is really making a difference. I was told by Glen to start off small due to the strange allergies. So that is what I’ve been doing.
I really want to share this with everyone because I understand how frustrating life is when you don’t feel good, especially when no one gives you answers for your suffering and you have no idea what to do to fix it or make yourself feel better. It’s extremely depressing. I strongly urge everyone to share this post and to try this product. God bless you!

The capacity of urban farms to tackle major issues such as poverty and reducing food miles should not be underestimated, and with more ambitious projects starting up every day, it might not be long until you see one appearing in your neighbourhood.

Excerpt:
Despite these barriers, our 2016 study into the state of urban farming showed that huge positives can come out of these spaces. For example, urban farms often act as a social incubator, bringing together communities and connecting cultures. Many also impact significantly on health and well-being, allowing city-dwellers to access fresh food and sometimes even supplement diets.
We found that those connected to The Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens were strongest. They gained value from the networking with other such sites across the UK.
A few in this extensive network have existed for over 30 years, and are still going due to the excellent support from both locals and the wider network. Ultimately, the idea of urban farming is not to replace traditional rural farms, but rather to complement and add value.
To push forward with urban farming, there’s a need to build on what works – in particular, to learn from urban farms in the US, which are expanding and are on a different scale entirely to anywhere else.

“Faced with the choice between changing one’s mind and proving that there is no need to do so, almost everybody gets busy on the proof.” -J. K. Galbraith
Last month, tensions between dark matter simulations and galactic rotation observations reached a new high. Despite all the successes of dark matter on the largest scales — for the CMB, for large-scale structure, for gravitational lensing and for galaxy clusters, among others — the simplest dark matter simulations reproduced unrealistic results for how individual galaxies ought to rotate. Moreover, a team of scientists uncovered a surprising relationship: between the normal (baryonic) matter alone and the observed acceleration in galaxies.
The correlation between gravitational acceleration (y-axis) and the normal, baryonic matter (x-axis) visible in an assembly of 153 galaxies. The blue points show each individual galaxy, while the red show binned data. Image credit: The Radial Acceleration Relation in Rotationally Supported Galaxies, Stacy McGaugh, Federico Lelli and Jim Schombert, 2016. From https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05917v1.pdf.
If dark matter were real, then the simulations needed to reproduce that result as well, which appeared to be a tremendous challenge. Yet in a new paper, two scientists from McMaster University, Ben Keller and James Wadsley, did exactly this. Even more impressively, they didn’t make new simulations, they simply took pre-existing ones and showed that this relation does, in fact, get reproduced among all their galaxies.
While the web of dark matter (purple) might seem to determine cosmic structure formation on its own, the feedback from normal matter (red) can severely impact galactic scales. Image credit: Illustris Collaboration / Illustris Simulation.

At least 247 people were killed after a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck central Italy Wednesday, according to Italy’s Civil Protection Department. In the small Italian towns hit hard by a magnitude-6.2 earthquake that struck in the middle of the night, rescuers feverishly dug through the rubble of downed homes and apartments looking for survivors. In one such rescue, shown on CNN affiliate Sky TG24, a firefighter in Amatrice clawed at the rubble, trying to get to a little girl. He pulled back bricks and other debris as his co-workers and other men leaned in. Suddenly there was a foot, and leg, then the other leg. Several people wriggle in to help the firefighter. The firefighter clutches a girl, said to be 8 years old, and walks her out of the huge pile of rubble as a volley of cheers erupts. The girl silently holds on. It is impossible to tell what color clothes she is wearing because she is coated in gray dust. “Bella ragazza!” one bystander says as the girl is carried to safety. “Beautiful girl!” Read More",english,2016-10-26T21:57:53.318+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,Earthquake Devastation Hundreds Killed: Rome Rattled by 5.4 Magnitude Earthquake to its East.

At UNC Greensboro, a young woman told Deeper Still and GAP volunteer Debbie Picarello that she was a Christian who believed God gave her a “choice.” In her mind, God was fine with whatever she wanted to do with her own body, even if it meant destroying her baby’s body.
She was failing the “choice” test, the test of life and death.
Debbie pulled out the ultimate life “cheat sheet,” the Bible. This is pretty good: In the most important test we will ever take, the test of life and death, God gave us the answers! Debbie showed her the answers she needed to know:
“For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful.” (Psalm 139:13,14)
In other words, God made us. He put us together Himself.
“For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body.” (1 Cor 6:20.)
Our bodies are not our own; they belong to God. This is especially true for Christians purchased by the Blood of the Lamb.
“Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and on the other hand death and evil … I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live.” (Duet 30:15;19)
The choice should be clear.
This was not what the young woman wanted to hear. She told Debbie she felt judged. Debbie assured her that she was not judging her, but was giving her the Word of the very God she claimed to worship. Her belief, that she could do whatever she wanted with her own body and the body of her child, was wrong. Her assertions directly contradicted the Bible.
It was indeed her choice to follow the Bible or not. But it was clear how God saw our choices. There are right choices and wrong choices. As followers of Christ, our choices are intended to be conformed to His likeness so that the whole world can know him. Pro-abortion Christians aren’t just dangerous for themselves and their children; they are dangerous for everyone on the planet.
God gives us the answers to the test, so that we can correct our course and pass with flying colors.
Understanding what Debbie was saying, the young woman shook Debbie’s hand and thanked her for speaking with her.
This is so important. Our most important outreach is not to the pagan world; we are taking truth to confused Christians led astray by complacent church leaders who work harder than Planned Parenthood to cover up the truth. Over and over again, your support is the difference between life and death. When you support CBR , you choose life.

By Michael Synder Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times …
“I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
“I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.”
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
“Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper …
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas …
Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas …
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon …
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots…
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “ no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate “…
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead “…
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up …
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.

Three years ago I did a blood-test and found that my B12 level was 179 and a normal would be up to 600,but still my doctor wasn’t convinced and he told me that I was borderline.So I started taking 1000mg everyday and my depression started to ease instantly.
You see, the problem with doctors is that they dont look at the real cause but only at the symptoms,they dont want to stop the cause,cos it will make you stop visiting,beside the fact that above all, the real cause before my B12 deficiency was that I recently had been through a traumatic situation and in order for the body to cope it releases cortisol and adrenaline which in turn eats up all your stored vitamins not just B12,so I also started taking magnesium and zinc as I also later discovered that I was also deficient in.
If you go back to your past before your the depression started you realize that there was trigger,say a bereavement of someone very close to you,a repossession of your house,news that a sibling has something terminal,in short, a very traumatic(shock) situation.

A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”",english,2016-10-26T21:59:03.640+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,7 Insidious Ways the Elite Are Making Americans Dumber (Video) | Power Elite,0.001,http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/30080/images/toxic-world-2.jpg,25,14,0,0,0,bs

CAUGHT ON TAPE: Bill Clinton Tells Alleged Mistress to Deny He Got Her State Job
NEW YORK – Speaking in a series of recorded phone conversations in 1991 with his alleged mistress Gennifer Flowers, Bill Clinton can be heard telling Flowers to deny that he aided her in obtaining a state job. “If they ever asked if you’d talked to me about it, you can say no,” Clinton can be heard saying in the audio.
Listen to the audio here:
Clinton was referring to news media inquiries about Flowers’ alleged affair with Clinton and Flowers’ concern that the media could raise questions about how she landed her job as administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
Clinton can also be heard advising Flowers on how to handle a grievance filed by a woman who applied for the same position and alleged that she was more qualified that Flowers. The complainant implied that Flowers was only hired because of her alleged relationship with Clinton.
 From December 1990 to December 1991, Flowers famously recorded a series of conversations with Clinton during the period he was Governor of Arkansas and considering a run for the presidency.
On October 1991, Clinton announced his bid for the Oval Office, with rumors of extramarital affairs threatening to derail his campaign.
Flowers recently provided this reporter with complete original cassette recordings of her taped conversations with Clinton, recordings that take on renewed significance as the issue of Clinton’s alleged treatment of women has reemerged during the 2016 presidential campaign.
The sections of the audio recordings related to the state job are not exclusive to Breitbart News. Those excerpts were played for the news media in 1992, one day after Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared side by side on 60 Minutes , where Bill denied a relationship with Flowers.
Clinton later admitted to one sexual encounter with Flowers in a 1998 deposition for the Paula Jones lawsuit.
The audio segments about the state job were widely reported by the news media in the 1990’s. However, the details may warrant revisiting amid numerous Clinton financial scandals that have since surfaced alleging pay-for-play, including those tied to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative.
In one section of the audio, which can be heard above, Flowers discusses the grievance filed against her and informs Clinton that she was being questioned about how she obtained the position.
Clinton says “Good for you,” when Flowers tells him that she found out about the job from a newspaper advertisement and pursued it from there.
Here is a transcript of that part of the audio:
GF – But anyway, then Wednesday, there was a grievance filed in my office when I got the job by a girl who felt like she should have gotten it, a black girl named (deleted). And they called me as a witness. So I go in and uh, nothing big came of it. It’s just that they were questioning me about how I found out about the job. And I said, “Well, that personnel said it that it was a possibility there would be a position,” and then uh, “they told me that it would be advertised in the newspaper. And it was and I pursued it from there.
BC – Good for you.
GF – Well, it caught me off guard ‘cause I… at first I just didn’t know… I just didn’t expect that for some reason. I thought about a whole lot of things about my qualifications and all that business, but I didn’t think about that.
BC – Yeah.
In the next section of the audio, Flowers expresses concern that the news media, which was asking her questions about the alleged affair, could find out about the state job.
GF: Yeah. We had a little bit of a scare recently because she had a spot on an X-ray. And she went and had it checked again and it wasn’t cancer. And it’s been almost, it’ll be two years in May that she’s now diagnosed cancer free. My stepfather has been through two angioplasties, but he’s doing good. And I am, I’m really, Bill what I’m afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I’m working for the state.
BC – Yeah.
GF – They’re going to make a big deal of it.
BC – Yeah.
In a subsequent conversation, Clinton specifically counsels Flowers to say “no” if she is asked about whether she discussed the state job with him.
Here is a transcript:
GF – Well the only thing that concerns me, where I’m, where I’m concerned at this point is the state job.
BC – Yeah. I never thought about that, but as long as you say you’ve just been looking for one, you’d uh, check on it. If they ever asked if you’d talked to me about it, you can say no.
GF – Well and I would. But I’m… here is the thing I’ve got to consider, too, is I’ve gotta go in there to work every day. You know what I mean?
BC – Yep.
GF – And if, and if these people start talking or someone in the press…
BC – Well, have they been nice to you there?
GF – Yeah they have been. But I don’t, you know, I mean, I just want you to know what’s going on. And I’ll be glad to hang in there.
BC – Has the, has the…
GF – But if it gets real…
BC – Has the grievance committee ruled yet?
GF – No. Not that I am aware of. Uh, I forget the guy’s name that appeared to be the head of it. Dudley or Dewey. Is there a Dudley or a Dewy or somebody? Do you know?
BC – I don’t know.
GF – Don Barnes was there. And of course…
BC – Is he happy with you?
GF – Well sure. (Laughter.) I’m good. I’m good at what I do, Bill.
BC – I know.
GF – But Don was, you know. He… He pretty much… When this guy was trying to beat up on me a little, said, “hey, I don’t see the relevance of this” and dadada. And then the head of the grievance committee said “I don’t either and I think we need to go on and you know go, not go along with this line of questioning.” And then that was about it except for just some other minor questions. But I found that curious that he would ask me how I found out about the job.
BC – Yeah.
GF – Now maybe at this point I’m paranoid but I mean no one has mentioned anything about it to me at all but I just found that, that I found interesting.
BC – Yeah.
In another conversation, Clinton tells Flowers that he will “nose around” to see if he can find out more about the issue, and he asked her whether the person who filed the grievance was being represented by a lawyer.
BC – Alright. I’m gonna nose around, if I find out anything I’ll call you. And meanwhile, uh, I can understand this grievance thing. I’ll, I’ll run that down.
GF – Well I don’t think there’ll be any problem there from what I understand, you know, that her deal was to either have my job or for them to create a position equal to mine.
BC – Uh huh.
GF – But it’s my understanding that then it’ll go to… even if they say yes, created position for her.
BC – Uh huh.
GF – That’s the same as Gennifer’s. Don Barnes can always say, “No, I won’t” and period. That’s it.
BC – That’s right. I mean that’s my understanding. So…
BC- Yeah. And then she could sue, but I doubt if she will. Was she there with a lawyer or a representative of any kind?
GF – She had a guy that works for the tribunal represent her which I thought was very inappropriate.
BC – Uh huh. Well, I guess maybe they do that for people…
Contacted yesterday by Breitbart News, Flowers explained why she says she turned to Clinton for help securing the state job.
She stated:
I found out my Mom had cancer and decided I wanted a regular job so I would have my weekends to spend with her. I was performing six nights a week and wouldn’t of had time. I asked to get me the job and he did.
In her deposition for the Paula Jones case, Flowers detailed Clinton’s alleged involvement in helping her secure the state job.
Here is her affidavit on that matter:
In early 1990 I told Bill Clinton that I wanted a job with the state. Bill Clinton told me to contact his assistant Judy Gaddy who would assist me with the application for employment. I met with Judy Gaddy in her office and she provided me with the details of what needed to be on the application. Judy Gaddy also told me to contact Clara Clark who set up a job interview for me. I was eventually employed by the state as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
Shortly after I was employed by the state, another woman who had applied for my job filed a grievance or some sort of complaint in which she alleged that she was more qualified and implied that the only reason I got the job was because I had had an affair with Bill Clinton. I was called to testify before a panel in connection with this proceeding. When I learned that I would have to testify, I did not know what to do, so I called Bill Clinton. I told him that I had been called to testify and asked what I should say. He told me to deny that we had ever had an affair. During the proceeding, when questions came up about my relationship to Bill, Don Barnes, his appointee and head of the commission, stopped the questioning.
In 1992, Michael Isikoff reported at the Washington Post that Clinton’s office admitted that it helped Flowers obtain the job in June 1991, while denying allegations that Flowers was Clinton’s mistress. Clinton’s office maintained that Clinton only helped Flowers because the politician felt bad that she was being hounded by the media over the sex allegations.
Isikoff reported:
Gov. Bill Clinton’s office said today that Clinton assigned a member of his staff to help Gennifer Flowers find a state job in September 1990 after she asked for his assistance.
Michael Gauldin, Clinton’s press secretary, also released two handwritten notes he said Flowers had written to Clinton. The first, in 1986, said she would appreciate his help in finding a job. The second, dated Feb. 23, 1991, complained that the assistant assigned to help her was not being very “successful.” …
Gauldin said Clinton was interested in helping her in part because he “felt responsible for all the women” who were being hounded by reporters after they were named in an unsuccessful 1990 lawsuit in which a state employee alleged the governor had used state funds in furtherance of extramarital affairs.
In the 1986 letter, Flowers enclosed a resume, said she “certainly enjoyed speaking with you by phone,” and said “anything you can do” to help with employment would be “appreciated.”
In the 1991 “Dear Bill” letter, Flowers complained that the staff aide Clinton assigned to the matter, special assistant Judy S. Caddy, “has not been very successful in the job hunting area.”
“Bill, I’ve tried to explain my financial situation to you and how badly I need a job,” Flowers wrote. She said she was enclosing “some correspondence that will be of interest to you” – a letter written by a lawyer she had hired threatening to sue a local radio station for repeating the 1990 allegations. The letter, which had previously been released by Clinton, said the allegations were untrue.
“Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to pursue the law suit to hopefully, get some money to live on until I can get employment,” Flowers ended the note. “Please be in touch.”
In 1998, the Washington Post again reported on the matter:
Flowers said her affair with Clinton had been over for at least a year but that about the time of the Nichols suit, she was looking for a job and turned to the governor.
Clinton agreed to help find her a position at an Arkansas state agency, Flowers said, and enlisted a political appointee named Don Barnes. Efforts to contact Barnes last night were unsuccessful.
“I don’t know Vernon Jordan, and I don’t know whether he is or is not telling the truth,” Flowers said. “But it reminds me of [1990] in regard to a position that Vernon Jordan supposedly arranged for Monica Lewinsky.”
Flowers was hired by the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal, a state agency, after an interview Barnes arranged and sat in on, according to Flowers’ 1995 written account of her relationship with Clinton.

by Leon Pantenburg
I bought this knife to review. At the time of publication, Kellem Knives had no sponsorship relationship with Survivalcommonsense.com. I’m a sucker for old time knife designs, especially when they are re-created with modern materials. IMO, this makes for a time-tested, utility design that will do the job.
I particularly like the Scandinavian Puukko design, so that’s why I got a Kellam Hawk.
The Kellam Hawk
The puukko is a Finnish knife, and the name lends itself to the Finnish word “puukotta,” which means “to stab/knife.” The prefix, “puu” means “wood” in Finnish. The design of the puukko is attributed to the indigenous Sami people, who created several knives to use for day to day tasks; the puukko was the smaller option, used to skin fish or animals.
“Although historical records vary, the puukko dates back about 1000 years. Both men and women carried (and carry) puukkos, although the sizes change depending on the person, as the puukko handle is meant to fit the hand size of the user. (From: EDC History: Pukko – A simple knife with a rich history.)
The old design is getting some attention from modern knifemakers. I recently reviewed the Battle Horse Knives Feather Stick, another knife with the Puukko design, and it worked out really well.
Here’s the Hawk’s specs:
Product Details:
Blade: 3″ Carbon Steel Handle: 4.5″ Stained Curly Birch Full Tang construction Dangler-style leather sheath Total Length : 7.5″ Grind: Convex is my all-time, go-to favorite grind , but scandi is a close second or third. For a beginner, it is the easiest to learn to sharpen on. The bevel is sharpening guide – all you do is lay it flat on a whetstone and hone away.
The scandi is also a great woodworking grind, and a practical choice for someone looking for a bushcraft knife.
The Hawk handle fits my large hands very well.
Handle: I have big hands – size large gloves – and many otherwise excellent knives don’t work for me because the handle is too short. I don’t like two or three finger grips. IMO, they don’t give a secure grip for hard work, and I’m concerned they might twist in my hand.
The 4.5-inch handle fits my hand really, really well. It is made of dyed curly birch, a common wood in Russia and Scandinavia, with nice figure. The wood makes a handle that doesn’t transfer heat or cold. This is a consideration for a knife that will be used in Finland’s frigid winter.
The diameter is large, which gives me a good, solid grip. When wet or slimy from cleaning fish, or bloody from butchering, the handle seems to get “grippier.”
A comfortable, safe handle is a really important aspect of a user knife. Pretty doesn’t cut it (pun intended) when there are lengthy cutting tasks to be done.
Steel: The high carbon steel holds a wicked edge. I don’t know exactly what it is, but the Hawk’s steel held up nicely to normal cutting and bushcraft tasks.
Traditionally, Blade materials can vary from the three-layer approach, which combines strong and flexible steels, to composite designs. Most are made with Finnish steel, Ovako 100Cr6, which is equivalent to U.S 52100 bearing steel, according to Nordic knife blog Nordiska Kniva r.
Spine: I would like the spine to be ground at a 90-degree angle, like an ice skate, so it could be used for processing tinder or scraping a ferro rod. It isn’t. But a few passes on a grinder could fix that.
Sheath: The dangler-style, form-fitted leather sheath holds the knife securely. Almost too securely. It requires a slight twist to loosen the Hawk. It’s a consideration – the knife won’t fall out, but it’s a two-hand job to remove it. This might be a deal-breaker for some users.
I find this annoying, but you can get used to the tight sheath.
Full tang construction with a brass bolster. I prefer a full tang on any rigid blade knife, even though I’ve never needed that extra strength. In fact, one of my favorite user knives, the Mora 840 Companion , has a plastic handle and a three-quarter tang.
For the strongest knife available, though, get a full tang.
Hand made in Finland.
The Hawk is a user knife, able to handle a variety of tasks.
In actual use , the Hawk lives up to the user reputation of the Puukko knives. It went along on Fremont District’s Webelos Woods, a Boy Scout outing, recently. It was used to whittle sticks and do the assorted tasks associated with camping.
On the way home, on an isolated section of highway, I saw a fast-moving car hit a deer up ahead of me. The front end of the vehicle was demolished, and the hood popped. The air bag deployed and the radiator was steaming.
After checking out the driver and passenger for injuries, (they were shaken, but fine) the driver and I followed the injured buck. It had dragged itself across the road and was severely injured.
It was still alive, with two broken legs, probable internal injuries and it was in agonizing pain. We called 911. Rather than wait a possible half-hour for the Oregon State Police to arrive, we ended the deer’s suffering with the only tool available – the Kellam Hawk.
The knife worked quickly and humanely for the sad, but necessary task.
That’s the mark of a good knife. It gets the job done.
Do you need a Hawk?
Everybody needs a good knife . The Hawk is based on a proven design, with quality materials. The Hawk has proven to be a very useful tool, and one that can be used in a variety of situations, from slicing a bagel at work, to hunting and fishing.
The knife retails for $74.95, and that’s a steal for a handmade knife. If you’re looking for a good-looking user, that you can work hard and pass down to your grandchildren, the Hawk is a really good choice.

Now within Job Posting Analytics reports in Analyst and Developer , users can view the full text of the most relevant and recent job postings tailored to their search.
Not only will the viewable postings be filtered by the selected variables, but the keyword searched will also be highlighted in the full posting text. This extra detail makes it even easier to analyze how employers are asking for certain credentials.
With the quick addition of new filters, the postings displayed can be narrowed from all in New York, to all in New York that mention “javascript,” to all in New York that mention “javascript” from Oracle Corporation.
The real power of this new functionality is in the context it provides. Now, users can step into the shoes of the employer and understand exactly what kind of talent they’re seeking in prospective candidates. We’re thrilled to see how this new functionality will empower users to better align programs with employer needs, identify emerging skills and occupations, and more.
Over the next few weeks, our development team will be working to increase the number of viewable postings from five to at least 50.

A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”",english,2016-10-26T22:00:14.396+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,This Is Definitely Pissing a Lot of Hillary People Off! | Alternative,0.001,http://www.mrctv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/Jeff%20Dunetz/facebookcensor-1024x535.jpg,5,5,0,0,0,bs

This article was written by Michael Snyder and originally published at Economic Collapse blog .
Editor’s Comment: In particular with electronic voting, the opportunity to flip votes and steal elections is almost unstoppable and will be very difficult to hold accountable. Nonetheless, that is exactly what activists in Texas and other key states should focus on. After decades of solid “red state” status, they are now talking openly about Hillary winning the Lone Star State and flipping it blue… despite being perhaps the most despised, unlikable and untrustworthy presidential candidate in modern history.
Take a look at the electoral college, and the shades of ‘blue and red states’ as things have been… if Team Hillary is able to steal Texas, there will be no way for Trump to win 270 electoral college, even if he wins Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and other swing states. Perhaps this has been their secret weapon all along, and the reason that she has been so arrogant throughout the entire campaign:
These are dangerous times, and the establishment – after systematically denying the voice of the people on many fronts – is now making a huge gamble at holding onto power even in the face of obvious fraud. Will there be any legitimacy left in this country? And what happens if/when this election is stolen and everyone knows it?
It Is Happening Again! Voting Machines Are Switching Votes From Donald Trump To Hillary Clinton
by Michael Snyder
Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.
Most Americans don’t realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romney’s chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.
Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times …
“I don’t know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me,” said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.
Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .
“I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romney’s name,” Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.
She said that the first time she pushed “Romney,” the machine marked “Obama.”
So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.
“Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times,” she told Fox News.
And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.
For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.
If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they aren’t even worth mentioning.
And of course this didn’t just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .
The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.
In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper …
Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes “switched.” The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.
And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas …
Gary and I went to early vote today…I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldn’t get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Don’t hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.
I don’t know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.
A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas …
Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyone’s vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!
And of course they weren’t the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon …
So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?
According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots…
Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a “software update” on ES&S machines that otherwise “omit one race” when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.
Let’s keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trump’s column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.
But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.
Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are “no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate“…
In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:
Nearly 2 million deceased registered to vote
Close to 3 million registered in multiples states
Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate
More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters
Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state
But despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled “ Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead “…
Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.
Americans overall are more confident that the nation’s votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.
Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.
And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up …
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russia’s intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.
But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.
Now that is a real “conspiracy theory”, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasn’t so serious.
During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.
The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.
And let’s watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.",english,2016-10-26T22:01:26.200+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,Electronic Voting Machines Caught Switching Trump Votes To Hillary: “Trying to Steal Texas” | Survival,0.001,http://i2.wp.com/shtfplan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/election.jpg?resize=453%2C229,0,1,2,0,2,bs

In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money.

A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”",english,2016-10-26T22:03:02.121+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,"X22Report Shadow Banking Is Back, and This Time There Is No Hope - Episode 1110a | Politics",0,http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/zklEV/~4/BoIi4eQ-kKE,2,3,0,0,0,bs

I used Google ruler to measure this, so it is their statistics. The base entrance is just outside the shadow of the crater, which means it was placed there deliberately to be in the light and make entering and exiting it with smaller ships much easier. Similar base entrance have been found before. For instance, a very similar entrance was found on Google Mars and was 160 meters across, but with similar design.

Here’s a letter to the Wall Street Journal :
Wilbur Ross’s and Peter Navarro’s defense of Donald Trump’s economic policies is mostly a mash of bunkum (“ A Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Growth ,” Oct. 26). Consider this claim: “Donald Trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation … and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce imports….”
Cut taxes? Bunk. Trump famously promises to raise taxes on Americans who buy imports. Reduce regulation? Rubbish. Trump promises more government intrusions into Americans’ commerce with foreigners.
As for ‘eliminating’ our trade deficit, Trump might indeed succeed on that front. But such ‘success’ would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the American economy being made an unattractive destination for investment. (Ross and Navarro seem to be unaware that to “eliminate our trade deficit” – such as was done, for example, during the Great Depression – is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of America’s capital stock.)
But Trump’s most absurd promise is to enrich Americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. Imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. Therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force Americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return – a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired.
But the Trump camp’s confusion runs even more deeply. Exporting for Americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. So a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase people’s spending power and to decrease it. It’s a policy meant to give Americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips Americans of the freedom to use those means. It’s the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle.

This is a good article :
“When Donald Trump rode down an escalator at Trump Tower to launch his presidential campaign in June 2015, he began galvanizing a populist version of the Republican Party.
But he didn’t create it.
The GOP that carried Mr. Trump to the presidential nomination was formed by waves of new voters who washed onto Republican shores in the last four decades: George Wallace Southerners, Ronald Reagan Democrats, Pat Buchanan pitchfork populists and tea-party foot soldiers.
The Republican establishment was happy to have the votes of these newcomers, many from America’s working class, and accommodated their cultural preferences on social issues from guns to abortion to gay marriage. What the establishment didn’t do was adjust the GOP’s economic approach to match the populist impulses—or even seem to consider such a shift necessary. …”
Rich Lowry put it well here :
“Our basic argument about Trump is simple and unassailable: He is a populist, not a conservative. Conservatism has always had a populist element, but it has been tethered to conservatism’s animating causes of liberty, limited government and the Constitution. Trump inveighs against elites and tramples on political pieties, but these causes are afterthoughts to him, at best.”
Ross Douthat put it better here:
“Sometimes this interdependency has worked out well. At its peaks of political success, the conservative intelligentsia has channeled and directed populism, responding to grass-roots passions without being ruled by them.”
The goal of the conservative intelligentsia has always been to CUCK the populist vote so that all of its anger and energy can be “tethered” or “channeled” into advancing the conservative agenda (read: classical liberal agenda) of the “governing wing” of the Republican Party. The role of populist voters in the GOP is to show up on election day and vote for a handpicked establishment candidate like Mitt Romney or ¡Jeb!
In this way, the conservatives can pass new free-trade deals for their corporate backers in the US Chamber of Commerce, start massive new destructive, unending wars in the Middle East, and keep the border wide open so that an endless influx of Third World cheap labor can further enrich the plutocracy. They figured all those yokels would just keep voting for them indefinitely because Democrats want to abort babies and seize guns.
Give them lip service! Give them token gestures! Give them round after round of failure theater! You know, it kind of worked too until their whole signaling structure broke down. That’s what happens when an elite loses its legitimacy. To borrow an analogy, the falcon doesn’t respond to the Falconer anymore and the elite falls.

It is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don’t. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I’d use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.
Back during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn’t have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.
After a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.
Once again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.
So, recently, I’ve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year’s presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can’t use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.
I recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people’s likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.
In order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.
Before I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.
About a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump’s tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.
Soon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.
I was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.
I say all this as part one of my preparation for what I’m going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I’d like to bludgeon you with.
Consider these points:
1) True Trump supporters could give a rat’s ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I’m talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.
2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.
3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called “reasonable Republicans” (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.
In other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.
Those observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.
The point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.
Here’s the current map:
Obviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.
But between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.
By the way, the “swing states” according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column. Those are indeed swing states. Numerically, the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.",english,2016-10-26T22:04:40.512+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,Clinton Vs.

Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money.

A singer decided to kneel during her performance of the national anthem prior to an NBA preseason game in Miami.
As Denasia Lawrence approached midcourt, she unzipped her jacket, revealing the “Black Lives Matter” shirt she has underneath and dropped to her left knee as she began to sing. Her stated intention was to protest racial oppression.
If the anthem is a symbol of racial oppression, then why would she sing it at all?
“We’re being unjustly killed and overly criminalized,” Lawrence explained in a Facebook post from Saturday night. “I took the opportunity to sing and kneel to show that we belong in this country and that we have the right to respectfully protest injustices against us.”
According to Miami Heat staff, there was no advanced warning that Lawrence was wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt nor that she had plans to kneel.
“I didn’t get paid to sing the national anthem nor was this moment about any sort of fame,” Lawrence wrote. “Black Lives Matter is far larger than a hashtag, it’s a rallying cry.”

The second arrived six weeks later, increasing the cuts to 109 workers. Then a third, in April, for 146 more. And a fourth, in June: 98. Three more notices followed, including 20 dismissals announced last week.
The “plant” in question — Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Like all big companies in New York State, the firm is required to file a “WARN notice” with state authorities when it plans to shed large numbers of employees as part of a plant closing, or “mass layoffs” involving 250 or more. Employers also must inform the state of smaller reductions under certain circumstances, and Goldman Sachs cited a “plant layoff” in each case. Last week’s notice brings this year’s job-cut tally to 443.With the run of notices, seven since the start of the year, the bank has signaled its intention to dismiss hundreds of employees in New York without placing a single, headline-grabbing number on the overall reduction, already its largest since 2008. The company’s approach differs from competitors, including Morgan Stanley, who have shown a preference for larger, one-time cuts.
Big Number
“When there’s a big number, people right away get that something is happening at that firm — it’s a negative,” said Jeanne Branthover, a partner at New York-based executive-search firm DHR International. “This is more, ‘We’re having layoffs and we don’t want to explain it.’ It’s more under the radar screen.”
The 20 people in the latest reduction were notified either this month or last, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing staffing decisions. The terminations will take place between Nov. 7 and Jan. 5, according to the notice posted on the state Labor Department’s website. The workers aren’t represented by a union.
Gena Palumbo, a managing director and the bank’s global head of employment law, is the sole Goldman Sachs contact listed on each of this year’s WARN notices. In 2008, the firm dismissed 900 people in New York in two different sets of cuts as the financial crisis raged. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs set aside $9.2 billion for compensation and benefits this year through September, 13 percent less than the first nine months of last year. Total employees, including consultants and part-time workers, fell 5.4 percent to 34,900.
While Goldman prefers a scalpel, its rival Morgan Stanley wielded an ax. That firm took steps to shrink in the fourth quarter, cutting 1,200 employees, including about 25 percent of the fixed-income trading staff, or about 470 traders and salesmen. When asked about how Morgan Stanley decided to make the changes, trading chief Ted Pick said he favored a bold move.
“We took the view of taking tough medicine,” Pick, 47, said in February.
Slower Approach
Goldman Sachs’s slower approach may reflect a desire to avoid cutting too much if trading or dealmaking comes roaring back. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has spoken about staying nimble to respond to revenue opportunities when they arise.
It also may reflect an outlook that got cloudier as the year progressed. In January, a person familiar with the firm’s thinking said Goldman Sachs was mulling cuts to more than 5 percent of its fixed-income staff. By March, that would expand to more than 5 percent but less than 10 percent. And by May, 10 percent.
The job cuts continued after first-quarter revenue was the worst for the start of a year in Blankfein’s decade-long tenure. While trading business bounced back in the second and third quarters, total trading revenue for the first nine months declined 11 percent from last year.
The WARN notices don’t capture firings outside New York and they don’t include voluntary retirements. More than a half-dozen partners have left Goldman Sachs this year, according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg.
“Everything Goldman does is scrutinized,” Branthover said. “This may be a signal or a sign that there are changes being made internally, or there are businesses and areas that are not performing satisfactorily. I would keep an eye on it.”",english,2016-10-26T22:05:24.790+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,Here’s How Goldman Sachs Lays People Off | Financial Markets,0,http://reddragonleo.com/media/1x-1-3.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs

An NSA Whistleblower says that Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails are easily accessible by the NSA and FBI should they desire to look at them, and he suggests that the hacks on the Democratic National Committee’s server was not done by Russia, as many pundits are claiming, but possibly by a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker.
William Binney, the architect of the NSA’s surveillance program, resigned on October 31, 2001, after working for the agency for more than 30 years. He thinks that an intelligence worker may have hacked into the DNC emails due to concern about Hillary Clinton’s disregard of national security in her use of a personal email server and her continued lies about her activity. Once accessed, there’s no telling where the information could have gone.
The “Putin did it” story is a fable used to sway voters towards Clinton’s war-driven agenda.
On a talk radio show, he mentioned that there are numerous questions that are not being answered about the hacked DNC emails and the network log available to the NSA.
Binney explains that there was no evidence tying the alleged Russian hacks to Wikileaks, and he says that they would have access to this information through the network logs. “So, if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and get them right now,” he said.
He finds their reluctance to speak to this matter highly suspicious.

Remember when the media, Barack Obama, and Democrats were finger-wagging and tut-tutting Republicans for saying Obamacare was going to be a failure? Remember how Obama said premiums were going to go down?
For the last 18 months, Obama and his fellow Democrats have been reduced to bragging about how many people are now “covered” by health insurance as if it was some real accomplishment. Two points to consider:
It is mandatory. People are merely obeying the law and getting a plan. The law’s intention was for healthcare coverage to be more affordable, and that has not happened. Insurers are recognizing this problem. Younger people would rather be in a position where they pay the fine (which the administration is not enforcing), rather than the out of pocket costs for a health care plan. The CEO of Aetna said as much:
Healthier people will avoid buying Affordable Care Act health insurance plans as premiums climb, threatening the stability of the market, Aetna Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said.
“As the rates rise, the healthier people pull out because the out-of-pocket costs aren’t worth it,” Bertolini said at Bloomberg’s The Year Ahead Summit in New York. “Young people can do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays and Saturdays, health insurance.”
Premiums for health plans sold to individuals under the ACA, known as Obamacare, are going up by about 25 percent on average for next year. Bertolini said that as costs rise, more individuals will decide not to buy health plans. That’ll push premiums even higher, unless a new president and lawmakers can find fixes for the new markets created by the 2010 health law.
The question over whether such problems get fixed is all dependent upon whether or no the President, be it Obama or Clinton, recognizes what divided government means. It is not to say, as President Obama believes, “Here is what I need, now pass it so I can sign it.” President Obama or President Clinton must recognize divided government means everything is on the table at the start of negotiations , not just what the President wants.

A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”",english,2016-10-26T22:06:40.225+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,The Mothership Arrives --- But It's Not What You Think! | Alternative,0,http://stateofthenation2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/maxresdefault-4.jpg,23,15,0,0,0,bs

News and Adventure from Glacier National Park
After surprising and then being charged by a grizzly bear, a couple fishing along the Lamar River effectively deployed their bear spray and saved themselves from injury on Saturday, October 22.
John and Lisa Vandenbos from Bozeman, MT, parked at a pullout near the Specimen Ridge trailhead in the Lamar Valley, east of Tower Junction. They walked cross-country to the Lamar River and, while scouting for fishing spots, surprised an adult grizzly bear who was feeding on a partially consumed carcass. The bear immediately charged the couple and came within nine feet when both individuals quickly discharged their bear spray.
The bear initially left. When attempting to charge the couple again, it ran into the original cloud of bear spray. Upon making contact with the cloud, the bear retreated all the way back across the river and up the adjacent hillside “as fast as it could go”. The couple did not sustain injuries and bear spray stopped the charging bear.
The couple left the area immediately and returned to their vehicle. They then reported the incident to a park ranger. Park rangers do not intend to search for the bear since this incident was a surprise encounter with a bear defending its carcass.
All of Yellowstone National Park is bear country. Reduce your risk of a bear encounter by carrying bear spray. Studies show that bear spray is more than 90 percent effective in stopping an aggressive bear. In fact, it is the most effective deterrent when used in combination with regular safety recommendations – be alert, make noise, hike in groups of three or more, do not run if you encounter a bear and stand your ground if charged by a bear.
“Yellowstone visitors care deeply about preserving bears and observing them in the wild,” says Kerry Gunther, the park’s Bear Management Specialist. “Carrying bear spray is the best way for visitors to participate in bear conservation because reducing potential conflicts protects both people and bears.”
Help the park increase the number of visitors who carry bear spray and know how to use it. Visit A Bear Doesn’t Care Campaign for more information.

(image credit: Justin Sullivan / Getty)
( The Real Agenda News ) More details have emerged about the never ending levels of corruption among the DNC, the Obama White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign, as a result of James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas’ investigation.
Corrupt practices go from promoting seemingly harmless campaigns to have people dressed as ducks at Trump rallies to collusion between the Clinton campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change.
In the third video put out by Project Veritas, Hillary’s cohorts confess how they managed to coordinate with her campaign and the DNC to set up what can be described at the very least as provocative moves to get the Trump campaign in trouble and to have the corrupt mainstream media cover the events while blaming Trump for violent outbursts outside his rallies.
As we learned from the previous two videos, it was the Clinton campaign itself the one using agent provocateurs to cause violence outside Trump rallies as these agents disguised themselves as Bernie Sanders’ followers.
In his second video, James O’Keefe showed how the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign, hire operatives to successfully carry out commit voter fraud on a massive scale.
Scott Foval, who has since been fired, admits that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years.
In his first video, Rigging the Election – Video I: Clinton Campaign and DNC Incite Violence at Trump Rallies, O’Keefe showed how second and third parties associated with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, were responsible for violence and attacks on Trump supporters all over the country.
As we said before, the veil of corruption that surrounds the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party continues to fall and people can easily see what is behind their fake progressive and fake liberal masks.

A prominent Iraqi military analyst disclosed that Riyadh and Ankara had hatched plots to transfer ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from Mosul to Libya but the massive presence of the popular forces and Russian fighter jets at the bordering areas of Iraq and Syria dissuaded them.

He added that the ISIL concluded that transferring al-Baghdadi through Tal Afar region to Raqqa in Syria is also impossible given the massive presence of Hashd al-Sha’abi (popular forces) in the Southern front near Be’aaj district, Northwest of the Iraqi province of Nineveh as well as the numerous flights done by the Russian fighter jets over the Syrian bordering areas with Iraq.

Arab Media: General Soleimani in Mosul Operations Room
Commander of the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Major General Qassem Soleimani has arrived in Hashd al-Sha’abi (popular forces) operations room in Mosul to play his advisory role in anti-ISIL campaign in Iraq, Arab media reported on Wednesday.
“Hashd al-Sha’abi will soon start its operations in Western Mosul to cut the ISIL’s supply routes to Syria and defuse the US plots to postpone the popular forces’ participation in the Mosul operations, and General Soleimani has also joined them as a military advisor,” the Arabic-language al-Akhbar said quoting renowned Iraqi figures.
No other source has yet confirmed the report.
Washington is pressuring Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi not to allow Hashd al-Sha’abi forces to participate in the Mosul liberation operations.
Spokesman of the Iraqi popular forces Ahmad al-Assadi had confirmed in August that General Soleimani would play a major role in operations to liberate Mosul, stressing that his country is in dire need of Iranian military advisors.
“The presence of Brigadier-General Soleimani in the operations to free Mosul and Nineveh province is necessary and General Soleiman is the greatest advisor that has helped the Iraqi government in the war against the ISIL,” al-Assadi told FNA.
“Hajj Qassem Soleimani is one of the most important military advisors of the Islamic Republic of Iran who is in Iraq at the invitation, demand and agreement of the Iraqi government,” he added.
Stressing that the Iranian advisors are in Iraq at the demand of the Iraqi government and have played a big role in most operations conducted by the popular forces, al-Assadi said, “They provided the Iraqis with strong views and important consultations with respect to their experience and capabilities.”
In relevant remarks in June, Iraqi Foreign Minister Ebrahim al-Jafari underlined that General Soleimani is in Iraq to help the country in campaign against terrorism after receiving Baghdad’s rigid request.
“General Soleimani is in Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi government to provide military counseling to the Iraqi forces,” the Arabic-language Sumeria news channel Quote: d al-Jafari as saying.
Also in June, Hashd al-Sha’abi Commander Abu Mehdi al-Mohandes underlined that General Soleimani is helping the Iraqi forces in their campaign against terrorism upon a request by the Iraqi government.
“The Iranian advisors, headed by dear brother Qassem Soleimani, have been beside us since the start of war and his presence has happened upon the demand of the Iraqi government and agreement of the Armed Forces’ top commander,” Mohandes said in an interview with Sumeria news channel.
He, meantime, said that the Iraqi nation is able to kick the terrorists out of Iraq with the possibilities in their hands now, adding that Hashd al-Sha’abi doesn’t have any political plan and merely supports the political process.

In the meantime, the Syrian fighter jets pounded Jeish al-Islam’s centers near the town of al-Reihan in Eastern Damascus.
Fatah al-Sham also lost a large number of military vehicles and tanks in the attacks.
The Russian air force also targeted terrorists’ centers on the Eastern side of al-Salamiyah, inflicting major loss and casualties on the militants.
Military sources said that heavy bombardments of the Russian and Syrian fighter jets pave the ground for the government forces to launch fresh operation to take back Souran and Taybat al-Imam.

UNIONDALE, NEW YORK — Sahn Ward Coschignano, PLLC has announced that Christian Browne, a Partner with the Firm, successfully appealed a New York State Supreme Court decision that dismissed a restaurant’s request to annul a five-year durational limit on the eatery’s parking lot that extends into the Town’s Residence District.
On April 22, 2015, the Board of Zoning and Appeals (BZA) imposed a five-year durational limit on an approval that allows Mim’s Restaurant to provide parking in a part of its property that is within a residential zoning district.
The restaurant then commenced an Article 78 proceeding, seeking to annul the durational limit. On November 18, 2015, the New York State Supreme Court, Nassau County, denied the petition and dismissed the proceeding.
On October 19, 2016, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Appellate Division, Second Judicial Department, overturned the lower court’s decision. In its ruling, the Appellate Court stated that the BZA does not have the authority to impose the durational limit on the restaurant’s parking lot because the Town Code does not confer any such power to limit the life of the approval.
Zoning boards routinely impose durational limits on various types of approvals given for commercial uses. Businesses often object to these time restrictions as being unfair and unnecessary burdens on their property rights because, by limiting the life of a zoning approval, zoning boards force businesses to regularly seek renewed permission for their ongoing operations.
“We are pleased with the Court’s decision,” Mr. Browne said. “We believe it strikes the proper balance between the rights of a commercial property owner and the need for the Town to protect the interest of the surrounding neighborhood.”
Nicholas J. Cappadora, an Associate with the Firm, assisted Mr. Browne on the case.

In a recent post, “Why do you believe what you believe” we said:
“Why do you know the sun causes skin cancer? You know it because years ago you read it in, or heard it from, a trusted source . Then you read and heard it often again, and the repetition caused you to believe it more and more until you know it.
The combination of “trusted source” and “repetition” inserts belief into our minds , and once there, it may be difficult to dislodge — unless we are exposed to a more trusted source plus repetition.
As you know, consuming saturated fat and cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease, while sugar does not. You have heard this from many trusted sources and it has been repeated endlessly in all forms of communication.
ScienceNews Magazine, October 15, 2016, Sugar industry sought to sugarcoat causes of heart disease
Payments revealed to authors of influential 1967 report touting fat and cholesterol as problems, by LAURA BEIL
Using records unearthed from library storage vaults, researchers recently revealed that the sugar industry paid nutrition experts from Harvard University to downplay studies linking sugar and heart disease.
Although the incident happened in the 1960s, it appears to have helped redirect the scientific narrative for decades.
Harvard University — what could be a more trusted source than Harvard University?
Note however, that Harvard University does not conduct research, nor does Harvard University verify the findings of research.
Research is done by people, employees of Harvard , and being employees of Harvard gives those researchers no special insight or virtue.
Yet the mere association with the name “Harvard,” implies intelligence and academic trustworthiness.
The documents show that the Sugar Research Foundation paid professors who wrote a two-part review in 1967 in the New England Journal of Medicine . That report was highly skeptical of the evidence linking sugar to cardiovascular problems but accepting of the role of fat.
The now-deceased professors’ overall conclusion left “no doubt” that reducing the risk of heart disease was a matter of reducing saturated fat and cholesterol, according to researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, who published their report online September 12 in JAMA Internal Medicine .
Now, we have the University of California, San Francisco, another trusted source, impugning the trusted Harvard results.
The sugar industry helped deflect the way the research was developing,” says study coauthor Cristin Kearns, a dentist at UCSF’s Institute for Health Policy Studies.
The belief in sugar’s innocence, and the sugar industry’s profit motive, were so powerful, it took a dentist, not a cardiologist to uncover apparently biased results from what ostensibly was a heart study.
Following the publication of the Harvard report, fat and cholesterol went on to hijack the scientific agenda for decades, and even led to a craze of low-fat foods that often added sugar.
It was only in 2015 that dietary guidelines finally made a strong statement to limit sugar. Researchers writing this year in Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases note that current studies estimate that diets high in added sugars carry a three times higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.
( The Sugar Association says in a statement on its website that “ the last several decades of research have concluded that sugar does not have a unique role in heart disease. ” )
Is this an example of deception with a true statement ?
Yes, unfortunately, the last several decades of research did absolve sugar from blame, and what does “unique role in heart disease” really mean? If sugar causes heart disease, is that a “unique role”?
The Sugar Association’s statement acknowledged the secret deal occurred, but pointed out that “when the studies in question were published, funding disclosures and transparency standards were not the norm they are today.”
Translation: The research lied, but back then, we didn’t have to reveal the lie. So, it’s O.K.
Journals now require all authors to list conflicts of interest, especially funding from a source has a vested interest in the outcome.
While a modern researcher could not take corporate money, even for speaking fees, without disclosure, the influences may be more subtle, he says. “We’re not talking about making up data, but perhaps influencing how a research question is framed.”
Revealing the source of funding doesn’t eliminate bias. And, though one reasonably may conclude that a high percentage of private funding comes from sources with an ax to grind, that doesn’t necessarily mean the research results are misleading.
But, such funding leads to the question: “What happens to results that disagree with the benefactor’s purpose?
If several, slightly different pieces of research show that sugar has an adverse effect on heart health, and one shows it doesn’t, what happens to all the negative research?
Andy Bellatti, cofounder and strategic director of Dietitians for Professional Integrity says that researchers don’t necessarily want to be cozy with industry, but sometimes turn to commercial sources because non-biased research money is lacking .
“The reason the food industry is able to do this is because there is such little public funding for nutrition and disease.”
Here is yet another example, among hundreds, of how cuts in federal deficit spending hurt America , though often benefitting big business.
And what does the need for an organization titled, “ Dietitians for Professional Integrity” tell you about today’s food research?
The scientific community should not reject industry money wholesale, says John Sievenpiper, a physician and nutrition researcher at the University of Toronto.
He believes that any scientist who takes industry money should adhere to an even higher standard of openness, including releasing study protocols ahead of time so reviewers can make sure the research question was not changed midstream to favor a certain conclusion.
Bottom line:
For many years, your belief in “benign sugar” was created by “trusted sources” and repetition. As with privately owned banks , the profit motive encourages unethical behavior. Corporations do not fund research out of generosity. They consider research to be part of their marketing efforts. Negative results often are twisted or hidden. Researchers, whether employed by Harvard University, the University of California, a private organization, or working alone, all can be swayed , consciously or not, to tilt their interpretations in favor of the money supply. Cuts in federally funded Research & Development grants are misguided if the primary purpose is to “save the federal government money” or to “make government smaller” (a huge, often unacknowledged disadvantage of libertarianism). While the federal government has political motives, it does not have a profit motive , and that alone helps make it a more trusted source for food & drug research than is private industry.

Ivanka Trump is going to have to back off from her father’s campaign, because the hateful and sexist rhetoric of Donald Trump is severely hurting Ivanka’s clothing and lifestyle brand.
Women are turning on Ivanka Trump as she continues supporting her father despite allegations of sexual harassment against him and a 2005 audio tape capturing him bragging in lewd terms that he can do whatever he wants to women.
Now, the growing group of women are boycotting her line of clothing, jewelry, perfume and accessories sold as part of the Ivanka Trump Collection. They are also calling on the stores that carry the brand, including Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s, to stop selling it.
It has even created its own hashtag, #Ivankant, as well as #GrabYourWallet.
From The Daily Mail :
‘If Ivanka Trump had distanced herself from the campaign I would not be boycotting her,’ Shannon Coulter, who called on Americans to boycott the brand earlier this month, told the Guardian.
‘But something changed for me when that tape was released.’
Coulter, who shared her own experience of sexual harassment at the hands of a male superior, launched the hashtag ‘GrabYourWallet’ on October 11, a reference to Trump’s offensive ‘grab them by the p***y’ remark from the audio tape.
The problem obviously for Ivanka, is that Donald Trump’s base, for the most part, doesn’t shop at Bloomingdale’s or Nordstrom, which are two of the largest stores that carry her clothing line, along with Macy’s.
What are your thoughts, should Ivanka’s business be hurt because of the actions of her father?
From Politico:
The New York Times cited a deposition from a woman who claimed that Donald Trump groped her under the table decades ago, but the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is certainly not a groper, his daughter said Wednesday.
“Look, I’m not in every interaction my father has, but he’s not a groper,” Ivanka Trump said in an interview broadcast Wednesday on “CBS This Morning.” “It’s not who he is. And I’ve known my father obviously my whole life and he has total respect for women.”
The billionaire businessman launched a Twitter salvo the “failing” newspaper for its “false, malicious & libelous story,” catapulting the story to become the newspaper’s most popular of the year, according to assistant news editor Theodore Kim.
—
Ivanka Trump said she read the Sunday cover story and “found it to be pretty disturbing, based on the facts as I know them, and obviously I very much know them” as a daughter and an executive who’s worked alongside him for more than a decade.
“I was bothered by it, but it’s largely been discredited since,” she said, referring to Brewer Lane’s criticism of the report. Brewer Lane, the ex-girlfriend whose first run-in with Donald Trump was used as the lead anecdote for the article, titled “Crossing the Line: How Donald Trump Behaved With Women in Private,” accused the newspaper of putting a negative connotation on her words.
“Most of the time when stories are inaccurate they’re not discredited, and I will be frustrated by that, but in this case I think they went so far,” Ivanka Trump continued. “They had such a strong thesis and created facts to reinforce it and, you know, I think that narrative has been playing out now and there’s backlash in that regard.”

A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”",english,2016-10-26T22:08:44.757+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,Breaking: Ivanka Trump Makes Tragic Announcement Both Donald Trump and Supporters Are Shocked (Video) | Prophecy,0.007,http://beforeitsnews.com/contributor/upload/106013/images/3705969F00000578-3731203-image-a-48_1470741574805.jpg,17,15,0,0,0,bs

I really wish you people who tend to believe a lie, either because you are too young, or two lazy to look up facts. The smoke screens are in place and you believe mainstream media, and don’t have a clue what is going on behind the scenes. If with forged votes, Hilary manages to win the election, we might have a little more time to act like there is nothing wrong with the country. But that too will be a smoke screen and a lie. You know truth matters, obeying laws matter. I dare you and your Hilary supporters to dig deep, and I guarantee you will find that so much evil is being planned and set up by the present establishment. If you read the Executive Orders signed by Obama you will realize He doesn’t plan to leave office. He plans to cause a situation, either by knocking down the propped up economy, which will leave millions without food, a government provided income, and will cause rioting like we have never seen before in America since a full 50% of people in America are supported by the government in some way. all he will have to do is declare Marsjhall Law then and his Executive Orders become the Rule of Law. Social Security and Medicare have been given to illegal immigrants , and taken from the people who worked hard all their lives and paid into the system to be assured of an income and medical care in old age. They will lose their income too, grandma is not only under the bus, but they keep running over her again and again as they kill people off with refusal to treat people for cancers if they have ever had a heart attack or do life saving surgeries. People 60 to 70 will have to prove their worth to the State to get life saving medical care. Age 70 up will simply be given pills to be in less pain and told to die quietly for the good of the state. For the last 30 years a recently declassified weather Weapon called H.A.A.R.P. has been shooting magnetic pulses up into the stratosphere altering wind patterns. The vapor trails in the sky, people have been told are to slow down global warming due to green house gasses. It is the wind pattern change that is causing every symptom of global warming, and is being done by the World Elite to wipe out the majority of our food supply, by severe droughts in the California, that provides 1/3rd of the fruits and vegetables in the world, The floods in the mid west make growing grain almost impossible, the Mega Storms and floods in the East and and Tornado alley are destroying people homes, their businesses, their lives. Hurricane Matthew as was Sandy were generated by that weather weapon bringing 3 storms together by seeding he storms with microscopic heavy metals, and using that electromagnet to move them together to form one big storm. The electromagnets have some more effects that are even more destructive. They are causing the tectonic plates around North America to move 5 times faster than anywhere else in the world. Sorry Leonard Decaprio should stick to acting, and let real scientists expose the coming tragedy if we do not stop that machine soon. Actually with what has been set in motion, it may already be too late to fix what H.A.A.R.P. has changed. Between the flooding on fault lines and the movement of the tectonic plates, we are having increasing earthquake activity, stronger and closer together. Yellowstone is constantly getting small quakes daily, and more signs of volcanic activity, even the buffalo don’t want to stay there. And Some other scientists have realized that the magnetic pulses in the stratosphere are causing the natural protection we had from most meteors is missing in some areas and instead we are about to become a magnet for iron based meteorites .
So you know what, it isn’t going to matter a flip if you don’t buy Ivanka Trumps clothes and boycott the stores if they don’t remove them. You will be fortunate indeed if you have food to eat, and haven’t lost your home to one of many possibilities all caused by the Elite, the CIA, and our elite puppet president, while he smiles real big and thinks how stupid we are. He hasn’t even tried to pretend anymore. In a speech he promised if Trump won, he had a legal plan to keep him from taking control. And if you think he will care how many young white girls die, think again. Since his executive orders give him total control over all food, water, housing, businesses and people. All he will have to say is, “The state has need of this” and he can take it. He can also arrest anyone for suspicion of speaking against the government and hold them without any charges indefinitely thanks to part of a the huge national Defense Act that passed that no one read but voted in… That bill is like Hitler’s enabling act that let him arrest everyone of note in any political party that stood against him. In 1933 Hitler arrested 200,000 legal German citizens who were leaders in political parties, most died in the first Concentration Camps he ever built, or rather had his slave labor build. We have camps just like those, with guard towers, and barbed wire facing in, not to keep bad people out , but top keep good people in. Of course most of America won’t take it lying down, so civil war will break out. I could probably tell you things for hours that have been going on, planned for decades culminating in a one world government, with over half the worlds population dead and gone, because the Elite who call us the eaters, can’t control too many of us. They want to outlaw private property ownership, and own it all themselves and basically take us back to the Dark Ages and use whoever is still alive as Serfs or slaves. I am telling you not what I think, but what I know. What I have researched, and what has been confirmed to me by two Congressmen, several scientists, and a few chasers…Chasers are real people who go wherever they have to go to get to the truth. One friend chased a train for 200 miles trying to take pictures of the changes one of the Bush Presidents paid to have refitted with triple to quadruple decked metal bunks with hand cuffs attached to the wall…a step up in comfort from Hitlers cattle cars. If you don’t know how to pray you might want to start because it is going to get real ugly, real soon.

Obvious political double standards
When it comes to scandal-plagued and utterly dishonest Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch clandestinely meets on the tarmac of Sky Harbor airport for a tête-à-tête with Hill’s husband Bill aboard a private jet — ostensibly to discuss grandchildren.
And, though FBI Director James Comey found compelling evidence of concerning issues in Hillary Clinton’s use of multiple private email servers, he concluded that he would not recommend charges against her, though he conceded Clinton and her aides were “extremely careless” in handling classified information. Comey refused to recommend an indictment against Hillary Clinton, despite “evidence” she violated laws pertaining to the handling of classified information, jeopardizing U.S. national security. These breaches occurred during her term as Secretary of State. “There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that information,” Comey acknowledged.
Additionally, Comey noted that other individuals in a similar situation would not necessarily be let off the hook with no charges, and would probably face penalties. “But that’s not what we’re deciding now,” he glibly fed us, the sheeple. “We are expressing to Justice our view that no charges be made in this case.”
“Justice,” of course, is U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch of the tarmac meeting fame. Addressing the people of the United States, the FBI director actually said that “no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear” on the investigation. He neglected to mention the inappropriate meeting between former president Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch aboard a private jet.
Hillary Clinton is free to run for the U.S. Presidency, guaranteeing Obama’s third term.
Here in Arizona, we have what clearly appears to be a personal vendetta carried out by a federal judge timed to coincide with the General Election in which popular Sheriff Joe Arpaio is on the ballot running for a seventh term. He was formally charged Tuesday with criminal contempt of court for ignoring U.S. District Judge Murray Snow’s order in a three-year old racial-profiling case. Arpaio acknowledged violating Snow’s order but insists the breach wasn’t intentional
Arpaio’s challenger in the race is once again rough ‘er up Democrat Paul Penzone, funded by multi-billionaire Socialist George Soros, who is contemptuous of national borders. Soros also funds Hillary Clinton and John McCain .
If convicted, Sheriff Arpaio could face up to six months in jail. A misdemeanor conviction would not bar Arpaio from serving as sheriff.

A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”
He exemplified various terrorists attack, including the 9/11, the Boston bombing, and the Brussels attacks, noting that they are all a “reflection of the Wahhabi philosophy.”",english,2016-10-26T22:09:17.250+03:00,beforeitsnews.com,US,6659,"Greg Hunter, ""USA Actually Bankrupt Now"" | Opinion - Liberal",0,http://beforeitsnews.com/mediadrop/uploads/2016/43/bbca84e195e12a04fb5f2569555b90945c543071.jpg,1,2,0,0,0,bs

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office denied CEI’s May 5, 2016 request for any Common Interest Agreements, which was made under New York’s Freedom of Information Law (FOIL). His office claimed the records are exempt from disclosure.
CEI is seeking all Common Interest Agreements entered into by the Office of the Attorney General and which are signed by, mention or otherwise include the AGs for other states or territories, as well as certain environmental activists. CEI suspects that these agreements may be a pretext for simply shielding documents from public disclosure.
After supplying a Common Interest Agreement to CEI, AG Schneiderman moved to dismiss our FOIL case against his office. Our October 26, 2016 filing opposes that motion to dismiss on the grounds that there could be more relevant documents yet to be produced, and we also want the common interest agreement ruled invalid, so that it stops functioning as a shield against disclosure of information by AGs.

A new year coming up, a new administration being sworn in, and new threats emerging, so will this be a winter like no other? Ice storms, power outages, mass shootings, financial crisis’s, possible attacks by other countries and civil unrest all loom large in the new year.
The nation’s power grids, yes plural because there are three of them are in disrepair, and much of the grid system relies entirely on computer systems, which it seems, are hacked on a daily basis. Russia is stirring and making war noises, North Korea has failed to launch but they keep trying and they will get it right soon enough, and then there is Iran running their fingernails down the chalkboard trying to get our attention. Iran wants a war because it takes the focus off of just how badly treated their people are and it always ends up being about money and power, so why not start a war is their thinking.
All in the name of something are wars started, wars are profitable, and they cover up a lot of atrocities committed by all parties, the fog of war, and all that. This winter we may or may not be in a war much may depend on just how the new administration handles things, however.
You cast your vote and pray for the best, of course, there is much more you must do. You as an individual and as a family or even as a community must prepare, because you may have to go it alone for days, weeks, or even months if the grid is hacked and shut down, or if we are attacked or if a natural disaster strikes. The world is in turmoil and much of what happens is simply out of your control, what you can control, however, is how you prepare and react.
You have to be prepared to live without your local, state or federal governments help. No garbage pickup, no clean water piped in, no natural gas for heat or cooking, and no snowplows patrolling the streets. Police will prioritize so that recent break-in with no injuries goes to the bottom of the list. Firefighters may be responding to fires set by violent protesters and ambulance services may have to respond to a mass shooting or injuries caused by rioting. You, the average citizen may very well be on your own, on your own in the dark in some cases for a very long time, in the winter of our discontent.
The weather will have an influence on you, and it must be dealt with along with the other threats looming. It may be time that you grocery shop for two weeks instead of stopping every night or every other night to grab something quick. This way you stand a good chance of having a week to a 10-day supply of food on hand for emergencies.
We generally recommend several months, and in some cases, several years’ worth of food, but the prepping landscape is changing, and finances are the biggest factor. For most Americans, it is not realistic to have a 6-month supply of food on hand, and with that being the case, you will have to adjust your shopping habits and meal preparation habits, so you do have some food reserves on hand at all times. It may not be much but it may be enough to get past many local disasters. If you can afford to have a 6-month supply on hand do so, but for many this is financially out of reach.
The problem with stockpiling food, however, is that it will need to be prepared and many today simply do not have the time or skills to properly prepare a meal, but during a crisis is not the time to try and learn to cook.
There is more to being prepared than having a spare bedroom filled with dehydrated foods, lanterns, batteries, tents, and sleeping bags. You also need skills, such as cooking, fire starting, how to stay warm outside when the wind chill factor is well below zero and how to prepare fresh foods like wild game or fish, for example, without making the family sick.
We have written dozens of articles about the skills needed, and it is well worth your time to review a few. This article is more about reminding you that regardless of what may be going on in the world, the biggest threat to you is usually local. Snow storms, local power outages, broken water mains, which means no clean water unless you boil it, or you lose a few days of work because of a snowstorm, or you experience icy road conditions and end up in the ditch or down a ravine. Local threats and national and world threats all have to be dealt with, but you start with the most likely at the time.
The Simplest Of Things Matter The Most
Keep your vehicle fueled up can save your life. If you run off into the ditch almost on empty, you can’t stay warm. You need a winter survival kit as well. Warm clothing and shoes for walking in snow and wet conditions, blankets and food and water protected from freezing. You don’t have to run out and buy emergency blankets, use one or two from the house and toss a spare jacket in the back and those old snow boots you never wear around the house. The simple things matter.
Buy a box of protein bars , and a case of water. For less than 12 bucks, you have water and food for a few days. Toss in some matches, a flashlight, gloves, a small shovel and hat and you are almost there without breaking the bank. You know what you need, it is just a matter of taking the time to do it, and if you look around the house you will find you may not have to run out and buy anything because you already have what you need.
You, of course, have to focus on the big picture as well, the threats from abroad, nuclear war, armed invasions and a major grid collapse but it is likely you will meet a snowstorm or icy roads before the other threats manifest themselves. Of course, we never know for sure, but life is always about the most likely and what is the most realist way of living your life day-to-day.

A leading US senator said the war in Syria would have been over by now if the US had put an end to its intervention when Russia entered the war-ravaged country.
“If the United States had just stayed out of it at that point, the war would be over by now; people would be rebuilding, refugees would be returning back to Syria, but the United States rushed anti-Tank missiles, and we used these so-called moderate rebels as a conduit to supply al-Nusra Front (also known as Fatah al-Sham Front), which is al-Qaeda in Syria,” republican member of the Virginia State in US Senate, Richard Hayden Black said in an exclusive interview with Press TV.
“If we were not supporting the war in Syria, I believe that the Syrians, combined with their allied forces from Iran, Lebanon and Russia… would move very steadily and restore the borders of Syria.”
The senate member, who visited Syria in April, refused to distinguish between militants and terrorists fighting the government of President Bashar al-Assad, saying, the two are “thoroughly integrated.”
“They really are one and the same, they’re part of the same army,” he said, citing a US defense intelligence agency’s investigation in 2013, which showed Washington’s ties with the terror group.
The outspoken state senator referred to plans by the CIA to transfer arms from Libya to Turkey and from there to Syria to supply the militants, noting that the move “evolved into an indiscriminate program of supplying all militant groups, including specifically ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
“We do it indirectly because it’s unlawful to do it directly,” he said, adding that the US keeps “extremely violent organizations… off the terrorist watch list because these are the agents that take our weapons and then distribute them to ISIL and al-Qaeda.”
In response to a question on why Iran and Russia are portrayed as the “bad guys,” while they are the ones really fighting terrorism there, as put recently by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, Black said the Republican candidate has a “clear understanding of what’s happening over there.”
“Sometimes, his rhetoric has to match the political mood of the moment… but I know a number of his advisers and they believe that our determination to topple the government in Syria is suicidal, that it threatens not only the entire Middle East but literally the entire world.”
He further warned that the US itself could be “threatened,” arguing that, “if Syria falls, it will be dominated by some al-Qaeda-related organization; Lebanon will fall; Jordan will fall and the entire area will be destabilized.”
The Vietnam war veteran also elaborated on his personal definition of the Middle East “axis of evil,” naming Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and “particularly” Turkey over their support for terrorism.
“Probably, three quarters of the rebels are not Syrian at all, they are mercenaries recruited by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia,” he asserted, describing the three countries as “the primary force behind the terrorist movement.”
“Turkey has invaded Iraq and Syria with heavy military forces. Turkey has really become a rogue nation,” he added, referring to a 1923 treaty that set the border between Turkey and Greece, saying that was even being questioned by President Rececp Tayyip Erdogan.
“And now you see this emerging threat against Western Europe by Turkey,” he noted, further adding that Erdogan “has made it clear that he looks to resurrection of the Ottoman Empire.”
“He has become more and more aggressive; he’s crushed the military, the free press; every powerful institution of the Turkish government has come under his iron fist and he’s now a total dictator. He’s a man who has said that he wants the constitution amended so that he will have power similar to those of Adolf Hilter… This is our great ally; we’re allied with a man who would be Hitler.”
He also blasted Washington’s alliance with Saudi Arabia, “where women are not allowed to walk out in the front yard to pick up the newspaper without a man’s permission; they can’t drive a car!”
“Somehow, this is part of the liberalization that we seek to impose on the Middle East,” he said ironically, calling it “bizarre.”
He also praised the resistance against the Saudi aggression by the people of Yemen, saying, “God bless them! The Yemenis are giving the Saudis a bloody nose,” despite being a “tiny little, poor nation.”
“I think the world recognizes that Saudi Arabia has just embarked in massive war crimes in Yemen,” he said, voicing regret over the US support for the monarchy.
“We don’t pay too much attention to them while engaged in war crimes because they’re our good allies,” he said, concluding that Washington is on a “suicidal course of action.”
“Saudi money pays the very top politicians in many Western nations. And they really have co-opted the American military into acting as mercenaries for Wahhabism.”Black referred to the Western media’s portrayal of Iran as a supporter of terrorism, saying, “The fact of the matter is that if you really look at global terrorism, it all emanates from Saudi Arabia.”

I'm about to be seriously un-PC.
Hillary Clinton appeared yesterday on El Gordo y la Flaca, a Univision TV show. I would never ask my loyal readers to watch these videos in their entirety. However, it is clear Hillary does not have custody of her eye movements. In the first video you can stop at 7s, 15s, and 31s to witness her whacked out eyes.
At the 1:35 mark of the second video, Hillary is introduced by a “little person” who conveniently helps her down the stairs on to the set. Hop up to 4:12, 6:01, 6:10, and 6:21 to see her eyes scramble. It is particularly noticeable at 6:10.

What is Vitamin E? Vitamin E is an important fat-soluble antioxidant compound that aids the body in neutralizing the harmful after-effects of oxidation of fats. Current research is even looking into the important role that this vitamin plays in stopping free-radical production, a key method of preventing the development of chronic diseases and aging. It is also a vital element in the overall maintenance of a healthy immune system.
Some studies are even looking into its role in preventing degenerative mental imbalances such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. And while many of us may do well in taking extra vitamin E supplements, we can use an organic diet to get a large amount of the daily requirements for this powerful antioxidant lipid. In fact, there are many common foods with vitamin E. You probably have a few in your house right now.
Foods With Vitamin E
Here are fifteen foods with vitamin E that you should strongly consider adding to your diet.
1. Almonds
Almonds are one the best vitamin E foods. Just an ounce of almonds offers a whopping 7.4 milligrams of vitamin E. You can also get your vitamin E needs in the form of almond milk and almond oils. We would recommend eating raw almonds, if possible.
2. Raw Seeds
Select raw seeds , such as sunflower, pumpkin and sesame, are another common food with vitamin E. In fact, eating just ¼ of a cup of sunflower seeds gives you 90.5% of your recommended daily value, making them one of the best vitamin E foods you can eat daily.
3. Swiss Chard
Swiss chard is easily one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat on a daily basis. Commonly known to be high in vitamin K, vitamin A and vitamin C, Swiss chard is another food high in vitamin E. Just one cup of boiled swiss chard greens will provide you with almost 17% of your daily recommended values.
4. Mustard Greens
Similar to swiss chard, mustard greens are very nutrient dense and will provide a variety of health benefits. Not only are they one of the best vitamin E foods, but mustard greens are also high in vitamin K, vitamin A, folate , and vitamin c. Eating just one cup of boiled mustard greens contains about 14% of your daily dietary requirements. We would recommend eating organic mustard greens, if possible.
5. Spinach
Spinach may not be your favorite veggie, but it is one of the best leafy greens you can add to your diet. Not only is it one of the best calcium foods and naturally high in folate, it’s also one of the best vitamin E foods as well. Just one cup of boiled spinach will provide you with approximately 20% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh spinach to your sandwiches to make them extra healthy.
6. Turnip Greens
While turnip greens may have a slightly bitter taste, they are very high in many essential nutrients. Like the rest of the leafy greens on this list, just one cup will provide you with plenty of vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C and folate. Not to mention approximately 12% of your daily requirements of vitamin E.
7. Kale
Kale is another great cruciferous vegetable you should eat as often as possible. Kale is very high in many nutrients, in fact, just one cup of boiled kale can give you almost 6% of your daily vitamin E requirements. We would recommend eating organic kale, if possible.
8. Plant oils
Most plant seed oils are very good sources for Vitamin E as well. The best oil with vitamin E is Wheat germ oil. In fact, one tablespoon of this oil holds 100% of your daily Vitamin E requirements. Sunflower oil is another excellent option, as it provides over 5 mg of the vitamin, and can easily be be used for cooking. Other great Vitamin-E-rich oils include hempseed oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil (with almost 5 mg of vitamin E), olive oil and safflower oil. We would recommend only buying oils that are cold pressed unrefined and organic.
9. Hazelnuts
A perfect snack during a long workday, eating just one ounce of hazelnuts can provide you with approximately 20% of our daily requirements of vitamin E. For an alternative to eating nuts, try drinking hazelnut milk in your morning coffee instead of milk or flavored creamer.
10. Pine Nuts
Add an ounce of these nuts to anything you please! One serving contains 2.6 mg of vitamin E. You can also use pine nut oil for added health benefits.
11. Avocado
Perhaps one of the tastiest foods with Vitamin E, avocados represent natures creamiest, oil-rich food. Just half of an avocado holds more than 2 mg of vitamin E. Avocados are very easy to incorporate into your diet. We would recommend adding sliced avocados to your salad, a sandwich, or mashed up as guacamole!
12. Broccoli
For generations now, broccoli has been considered one of the best detox foods , but it’s also one of the healthiest foods high in Vitamin E. Just one cup of steamed broccoli will provide you with 4% of your daily requirements. Broccoli may not be as nutrient dense as other Vitamin E foods on this list, but it is definitely one of the healthiest foods you can eat daily.
13. Parsley
An excellent spice, parsley is another great Vitamin E food. Try adding fresh parsley to salads and dishes for an extra Vitamin-E kick. Dried parsley will also provide you with this important vitamin, but the fresher the better.
14. Papaya
This popular fruit is most commonly known as one of the best vitamin C foods , but it’s also high in Vitamin E. Just one papaya will give you approximately 17% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh or frozen papaya to fruit smoothies, along with other fruity vitamin E foods on this list for an extra healthy snack!
15. Olives
From the oil to the fruit, eating olives is an excellent way of getting your daily needs for vitamin E. Just one cup of olives can give you approximately 20% of your daily recommended amount.
These are just a few examples of foods with vitamin E. There are plenty more that aren’t listed here. Which vitamin E food is your favorite? Let’s hear your thoughts below.

An architect of regime-change, coups, no-fly zones, rule of the rich and mass incarceration is about to become Commander-in-Chief, yet the bulk of what passes for the Left is “engaged in a 1930s-style ‘united front’ against a ‘fascism’ that was never a threat in 21 st century America.” Donald Trump, the orange menace, didn’t have a chance of becoming president. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, is a 21 st century fascist and threat to life on Earth. Fighting Ghost Fascists While Aiding Real Ones by BAR executive editor Glen Ford 
“Trump’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton’s imperial Big Tent.” 
Hillary Clinton’s impending -- and totally predictable -- landslide victory on November 8 will prove only that there never was any danger of a “fascist” white nationalist takeover of the U.S. executive branch of government in 2016. That was always a red (or “orange”) herring, a phony “barbarians at the gate” threat that -- as Wikileaks documents confirmed -- John Podesta and Hillary’s other handlers fervently hoped would convey “lesser evil” status to their manifestly unpopular candidate. 
There was nothing particularly devious or out of the ordinary in the Hillary camp’s favoring Donald Trump or, alternatively, Ted Cruz. It is standard Democratic Party practice to position themselves just to the left of the Republicans. In a duopoly electoral system, victory lies in where the cake is cut. By hugging close to the GOP’s flanks, national Democratic candidates can lay claim to a “center-left” spectrum of political space that encompasses a clear majority of U.S. public opinion on most issues. By this calculus, Democrats are supposed to win, unless they are tripped up on the closely related issues of race (failure to “stand up” to the Blacks) and foreign policy (failure to “stand up” to whoever is the designated foreign enemy). 
Race is the trickiest part of the equation, since white supremacy is embedded in the American political conversation, hiding just beneath the surface of most discourse on social and economic policy. 
“His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites.” 
Trump thought he could win by combining an overt white racist appeal with an anti-corporate message that laid the blame on Wall Street for (white) American job losses and falling living standards. He also calculated -- correctly, it turns out -- that in the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown, many white Americans were more upset about their own economic and social status than they were angry at Russians; that they wanted regime change at home more than abroad. 
Both of Trump’s central policies backfired, dooming his campaign. His overt racism probably weakened his appeal to whites, who have given majorities to national Republicans since 1968 but whose self-image is that they are not, as individuals, racist. (Certainly, white women found further reason to reject his candidacy.) Much more spectacularly, Trump’s anti-“free trade” stance and opposition to regime change and military confrontation with Russia and China drove most of the Republican-allied section of the ruling class straight into Hillary Clinton’s imperial Big Tent. 
At the national level, the duopoly system, as we had known it, virtually ceased to exist – a fact dramatically driven home by the near-universal corporate media rejection of Donald Trump, the candidacy they had done so much to create. The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election, a potential historic opening to a far wider space of progressive political struggle, including on the moribund electoral level. With the ruling class gathered in one Big Tent, and the overt racists occupying the imploded shell of the GOP, the system itself was in disarray. What was once two vibrant parties of the ruling class, with a virtual monopoly on the totality of the electorate, had become one ruling class party plus a hollowed-out husk, at least temporarily occupied by white nationalists under the leadership of a narcissistic and incoherent billionaire, yet without enough funds to mount a competitive general election campaign. 
“The near-collapse of the duopoly system was the great fracture of the 2016 election.” 
In these pages, we had been saying since last year that Donald Trump could not win; that Bernie Sanders’ fate would be sealed in the southern primaries; and that, although ruling class money would insure Clinton an election by landslide, it could not buy her legitimacy among a significant section of the Democratic “base,” who would now be pushed to the latrine area of her Big Tent. As we wrote on May 18 of this year: 
“Outsized fear of Trump is hysteria. These days, the ‘brown shirts’ wear blue. Hillary is the candidate of Wall Street, War and Austerity – not Trump, the racist America Firster. And, he can’t win, anyway – not with tens of millions of ‘moderate’ Republicans and most of the party’s funders rushing into Hillary’s welcoming embrace.” 
But sadly, hysteria does reign in most of the “left” precincts of America. Those who did not hesitate to kick Hillary when she appeared to be “down” -- in those heady days when they imagined it was possible she could lose to Sanders -- are terrified to kick her when she is “up” and primed to take the helm of the hyper-power. They are engaged in a 1930s-style “united front” against a “fascism” that was never a threat in 21 st century America, where a different kind of dictatorship of the rich (but also a fascism) has made brown-shirts (and Klansmen) utterly superfluous. These trembling leftists refuse to oppose the modern manifestation of fascism, which is now firmly entrenched in power with Hillary as its champion, in favor of a crusade against an “orange” menace that did not have a ghost of a chance of seizing national power. They have made themselves perfectly irrelevant and useless -- except, of course, to the fascists-in-charge.

When people unfamiliar with the liberty movement stumble onto the undeniable fact of the “conspiracy” of globalism they tend to look for easy answers to understand what it is and why it exists. Most people today have been conditioned to perceive events from a misinterpreted standpoint of “Occam’s Razor”— they wrongly assume that the simplest explanation is probably the right one. 
In fact, this is not what Occam’s Razor states. Instead, to summarize, it states that the simplest explanation GIVEN THE EVIDENCE at hand is probably the right explanation. 
It has been well known and documented for decades that the push for globalism is a deliberate and focused effort on the part of a select “elite;” international financiers, central bankers, political leaders and the numerous members of exclusive think tanks. They often openly admit their goals for total globalization in their own publications, perhaps believing that the uneducated commoners would never read them anyway. Carroll Quigley, mentor to Bill Clinton and member of the Council on Foreign Relations, is often quoted with open admissions to the general scheme: 
The powers of financial capitalism had (a) far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences. The apex of the systems was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland; a private bank owned and controlled by the world’s central banks which were themselves private corporations. Each central bank… sought to dominate its government by its ability to control Treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchanges, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world. – Carroll Quigley, Tragedy And Hope 
The people behind the effort to enforce globalism are tied together by a particular ideology, perhaps even a cult-like religion, in which they envision a world order as described in Plato’s Republic . They believe that they are “chosen” either by fate, destiny or genetics to rule as philosopher kings over the rest of us. They believe that they are the wisest and most capable that humanity has to offer, and that through evolutionary means, they can create chaos and order out of thin air and mold society at will. 
This mentality is evident in the systems that they build and exploit. For example, central banking in general is nothing more than a mechanism for driving nations into debt, currency devaluation, and ultimately, enslavement through widespread economic extortion. The end game for central banks is, I believe, the triggering of historic financial crisis, which can then be used by the elites as leverage to promote complete global centralization as the only viable solution. 
This process of destabilizing economies and societies is not directed by the heads of the various central banks. Instead, it is directed by even more central global institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, as outlined in revealing mainstream articles like “ Ruling The World Of Money “published by Harper’s Magazine . 
We also find through the words of globalists that the campaign for a “new world order” is not meant to be voluntary. 
… When the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system. Countless people … will hate the new world order … and will die protesting against it. When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people. – HG Welles, Fabian Socialist and author of The New World Order 
In short, the ‘house of world order’ will have to be built from the bottom up rather than f rom the top down. It will look like a great ‘booming, buzzing confusion,’ to use William James’ famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault. – Richard Gardner, member of the Trilateral Commission, published in the April, 1974 issue of Foreign Affairs 
The New World Order cannot happen without U.S. participation, as we are the single most significant component. Yes, there will be a New World Order, and it will force the United States to change its perceptions. – Henry Kissinger, World Action Council, April 19, 1994 
I could quote globalists all day long, but I think you get the general idea. While some people see globalism as a “natural offshoot” of free markets or the inevitable outcome of economic progress, the reality is that the simplest explanation (given the evidence at hand) is that globalism is an outright war waged against the ideal of sovereign peoples and nations. It is a guerrilla war, or fourth generation warfare, waged by a small group of elites against the rest of us. 
A significant element of this war concerns the nature of borders. Borders of nations, states and even towns and villages, are not just lines on a map or invisible barriers in the dirt. This is what the elites and the mainstream media would like us to believe. Instead, borders when applied correctly represent principles; or at least, that is supposed to be their function. 
Human beings are natural community builders; we are constantly seeking out others of like-mind and like-purpose because we understand subconsciously that groups of individuals working together can (often but not always) accomplish more. That said, human beings also have a natural tendency to value individual freedom and the right to voluntary association. We do not like to be forced to associate with people or groups that do not hold similar values. 
Cultures erect borders because, frankly, people have the right to vet those who wish to join and participate in their endeavors. People also have a right to discriminate against anyone who does not share their core values; or, in other words, we have the right to refuse association with other groups and ideologies that are destructive to our own. 
Interestingly, globalists and their mouthpieces will argue that by refusing to associate with those who might undermine our values, it is WE who are violating THEIR rights. See how that works? 
Globalists exploit the word “isolationism” to shame sovereignty champions in the eyes of the public, but there is no shame in isolation when such principles as freedom of speech and expression or the right to self defense are on the line. There is also nothing wrong with isolating a prosperous economic model from unsuccessful economic models. Forcing a decentralized free market economy to adopt feudal administration through central banking and government will eventually destroy that model. Forcing a free market economy into fiscal interdependency with socialist economies will also most likely undermine that culture. Just as importing millions of people with differing values to feed on a nation after it has had socialism thrust upon it is a recipe for collapse. 
The point is, some values and social structures are mutually exclusive; no matter how hard you try, certain cultures can never be homogenized with other cultures. You can only eliminate one culture to make room for the other in a border-less world. This is what globalists seek to achieve. It is the greater purpose behind open border policies and globalization – to annihilate ideological competition so that humanity thinks it has no other option but the elitist religion. The ultimate end game of globalists is not to control governments (governments are nothing more than a tool). Rather, their end game is to obtain total psychological influence and eventually consent from the masses. 
Variety and choice have to be removed from our environment in order for globalism to work, which is a nice way to say that many people will have to die and many principles will have to be erased from the public consciousness. The elites assert that their concept of a single world culture is the pinnacle principle of mankind, and that there is no longer any need for borders because no other principle is superior to theirs. As long as borders as a concept continue to exist there is always the chance of separate and different ideals rising to compete with the globalist philosophy. This is unacceptable to the elites. 
This has led not so subtle propaganda meme that cultures that value sovereignty over globalism are somehow seething cauldrons of potential evil. Today, with the rising tide of anti-globalist movements, the argument in the mainstream is that “populists” (conservatives) are of a lower and uneducated class and are a dangerous element set to topple the “peace and prosperity” afforded by globalist hands. In other words, we are treated like children scrawling with our finger paints across a finely crafted Mona Lisa. Once again, Carroll Quigley promotes (or predicts) this propaganda decades in advance when he discusses the need for “working within the system” for change instead of fighting against it: 
For example, I’ve talked about the lower middle class as the backbone of fascism in the future. I think this may happen. The party members of the Nazi Party in Germany were consistently lower middle class. I think that the right-wing movements in this country are pretty generally in this group. – Carroll Quigley, from Dissent: Do We Need It? 
The problem is that these people refuse to confront the fruits of globalization that can be observed so far. Globalists have had free rein over most of the world’s governments for at least a century, if not longer. As a consequence of their influences, we have had two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Great Recession which is still ongoing, too many regional conflicts and genocides to count and the systematic oppression of free agent entrepreneurs, inventors and ideas to the point that we are now suffering from social and financial stagnation. 
The globalists have long been in power, yet, the existence of borders is blamed for the storm of crises we have endured for the past hundred years? Liberty champions are called “deplorable” populists and fascists while globalists dodge blame like slimy slithering eels? 
This is the best card the globalists have up their sleeve, and it is the reason why I continue to argue that they plan to allow conservative movements to gain a measure of political power in the next year, only to pull the plug on international fiscal life support and blame us for the resulting tragedy. 
There is no modicum of evidence to support the notion that globalization, interdependency and centralization actually work. One need only examine the economic and immigration nightmare present in the EU to understand this. So, the globalists will now argue that the world is actually not centralized ENOUGH. That’s right; they will claim we need more globalization, not less, to solve the world’s ailments. 
In the meantime, principles of sovereignty have to be historically demonized — the concept of separate cultures built on separate beliefs has to be psychologically equated with evil by future generations. Otherwise, the globalists will never be able to successfully establish a global system without borders. 
Imagine, for a moment, an era not far away in which the principle of sovereignty is considered so abhorrent, so racist, so violent and poisonous that any individual would be shamed or even punished by the collective for entertaining the notion. Imagine a world in which sovereignty and conservatism are held up to the next generation as the new “original sins;” dangerous ideas that almost brought about the extinction of man. 
This mental prison is where globalists want to take us. We can break free, but this would require a complete reversal of the way in which we participate in society. Meaning, we need a rebellion of voluntary associations. A push for decentralization instead of globalization. Thousands upon thousands of voluntary groups focusing on localization, self reliance and true production. We must act to build a system that is based on redundancy instead of fragile interdependency . We need to go back to an age of many borders, not less borders, until every individual is himself free to participate in whatever social group or endeavor he believes is best for him, as well as free to defend against people that seek to sabotage him; a voluntary tribal society devoid of forced associations. 
Of course, this effort would require unimaginable sacrifice and a fight that would probably last a generation. To suggest otherwise would be a lie. I can’t possibly convince anyone that a potential future based on a hypothetical model is worth that sacrifice. I have no idea whether it is or is not. I can only point out that the globalist dominated world we live in today is clearly doomed. We can argue about what comes next after we have removed our heads from the guillotine.

As the death toll in Yemen surpasses 10,000, Saudi Arabia, one of the principal parties in the conflict, is poised to be reelected to the UN human rights body. Saudi airstrikes are responsible for the majority of the nearly 4,000 civilian deaths in Yemen. 
A secret ballot vote at the UN General Assembly on Friday will select the 14 members of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), or a third of its 47 members. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China, and Japan are running for the four seats from the Asia-Pacific region, and are all expected to secure seats. 
Riyadh’s term at the UNHRC would be the third in a row, and its presence at the body has been increasingly puzzling to human rights groups, given its record of twisting arms at the UN to hush up its rights abuses. 
In June, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon publicly admitted that Saudi Arabia threatened to withdraw funding from numerous programs due to an upcoming report on violations of children’s rights. The report would list the Arab kingdom among violators over the toll its military campaign and blockade of Yemen has taken on children. The threat resulted in Saudi Arabia’s removal from the blacklist, even though Riyadh’s tactics had been exposed. 
“The report describes horrors no child should have to face,” Ban Ki-moon told reporters at the time. “At the same time, I also had to consider the very real prospect that millions of other children would suffer grievously if, as was suggested to me, countries would defund many UN programs.” 
“It is unacceptable for UN member states to exert undue pressure,” the secretary-general added, pledging to review the removal of the Saudis from the list. 
This incident of Saudi Arabia working against UN human rights efforts is far from being isolated. In Yemen, the kingdom used control of air traffic to prevent foreign journalists, employees of international aid organizations, and UN officials from visiting the war-torn country and reporting on the situation there. 
In September, it used diplomatic pressure against the Netherlands after it introduced a resolution at the UNHRC that would launch an independent investigation into airstrikes on Yemen. The Dutch proposal failed and an Arab version was passed, one which entrusted the probe to the exiled Yemeni government, which the Saudis want to put back into power through its military actions. 
Domestically, Riyadh’s policies often run against those of the UN human rights body. Seven petitions to allow special rapporteurs for the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights to investigate abuses in Saudi Arabia remain pending , some for over a decade. 
The kingdom was also reported to persecute its own subjects who cooperate with UN investigations. For instance, human rights defender Mohammed al-Qahtani, who contributed to several UNHRC reports, was accused of things like “distorting the reputation of the country” and “provoking international organizations to adopt stances against the kingdom.” He is currently serving a lengthy prison term. 
While far from being the only authoritarian regime with a seat at the UNHRC, Saudi Arabia maintains some of the most restrictive domestic policies. Homosexuality and conversion from Islam to another religion are punishable by death. Sentences include corporal punishment, as highlighted by the case of blogger Raif Badawi who is to be flogged 1,000 times while serving a 10-year sentence for “insulting Islam.” 
Saudi Arabia is also one of the world’s most enthusiastic executors. The number of beheadings spiked under King Salman with 157 executions reported in 2015, and 124 between January and September 2016.

As the United States squanders the enormous good will and respect it once had by marching forward on the tired legs of a dying empire, the U.S.’ enemies-of-its-own-making are beginning to forge new alliances that might not have been a reality had the U.S. at the very least pursued a strategy of positive reinforcement and cooperation as opposed to a policy of tension, pillage, and war. 
The first major crack in the iron curtain of the Anglo-American world hegemon started becoming apparent with the emergence of the U.S. destabilization and proxy war against Syria. While the NATO/American proxy war has left hundreds of thousands of Syrians dead, hundreds of thousands more displaced, and destroyed much of the Syrian infrastructure as well as crippled the Syrian economy, another result of American policy in Syria is that it has strengthened and even created alliances that otherwise may not have existed not only between Middle Eastern countries but European, Asian, and African nations as well. 
Unfortunately for the United States, these new alliances of its targers were created out of a political, economic, and military necessity by which to survive the Western onslaught of destabilization, sanctions, and war aimed at these respective nations. Thus, if the West wanted to break resistance to its hegemonic system, it has managed instead to encourage the opposite. 
While already an axis of mutual interest, the crisis in Syria has resulted in the strengthening of ties between Syria, Iran, and Hezbollah. Not only a strategic alliance, this arc of resistance has solidified ties that are slowly pulling Iraq away from the influence of the United States. Indeed, the Iraqis are still tethered to the United States due largely to bribery, deception, economic threats, and the decreasing dependency on the United States for military assistance to combat ISIS. 
Syria itself is spreading its wings as it mops up America’s terrorists. Reaching out to not only the nations of the resistance axis and Russia, it is reaching out and solidifying relationships with Russia and China as well as with other European and African nations like the Czech Republic and Egypt. 
Likewise, if the ties between Iran and the Houthis were not strong enough before the U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition, they certainly are now. Despite no credible evidence that Iran is providing weapons to the Houthis, there is little doubt that the Iranians are providing whatever support they can in whatever form that can take and that they will do so in the future. 
Russia, of course, factors in as the biggest and most important player in the strategic realignment with its insistence (which has come as a result of the U.S. aggression across the planet) in the emergence of a “multi-polar” world. Russia’s reunification with Crimea, support of the Ukrainian rebels, as well as its support of Syria is only the tip of the iceberg. A growing cooperation with China and with a host of other nations throughout the world – by virtue of the carrot as opposed to the stick – is rapidly drawing more and more nations into the Russian fold. 
Iran, too, having not expressed a desire for empire nonetheless is now beginning to express interest in stretching its muscles and expanding its own influence. How much of this newly expressed desire is innate and how much is simply a necessary act of self-defense against and encroaching war machine that sees Iran as next in line for destruction is unclear. The fact that it is happening, however, is not in doubt. 
These new alliances may not have ever taken shape and solidified had the United States not insisted on acting as the battering ram for the Anglo-American system across the world and squandered all the respect and good will that existed for it in so many nations. The U.S. could easily have won many nations over by using positive reinforcement and enticement such as development, higher living standards, and peace. Instead, it has bombed, burned, bribed, and destabilized itself across the globe to the point that it has become the number one threat to world peace, a reality that is being acknowledged by more and more countries by the day. 
What could have been the greatest force for peace, stability, democracy, and high living standards has been utterly squandered into being the greatest force for the opposite. If the United States continues down this path of imperialism, it will soon find itself not only hated the world over, but collapsed, weak, and bitter while the nations it has targeted in the final days of its war push have united against it. We can only hope that they have more restraint, good will, and compassion than what the U.S. has shown to them.",english,2016-10-26T22:45:07.602+03:00,blacklistednews.com,US,93026,U.S. War Policy Has Created The Multi-polar World,0,http://www.blacklistednews.com/images/blacklistednews-LOGO-c1.png,0,0,0,0,0,bs

Just yesterday we noted several social media complaints from Texas voters who alleged that when they voted a straight republican ticket that voting machines were switching their presidential selection to Clinton/Kaine. While most undoubtedly dismissed these reports as conspiracy theories, new official reports from Chambers County, Texas suggest that there might be some truth to the voting machine ""irregularities"". According to an NBC affiliate , polling stations in Chambers County had to enact emergency protocols yesterday and revert back to paper ballotsafter a ""glitch"" was discovered in the county's voting machines. 
The issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in when she reviewed her electronic ballot Hawthorne told 12News on Tuesday. 

An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. 

ES&S is the vendor that Chambers County contracts with to program their voting machines. 

The Texas Secretary of State's office informed Hawthorne to create emergency paper ballots to continue voting until the problem could be fixed according to the release. 
Below is the official press release from the Chambers County Clerk: 

Of course, these confirmed reports from Chambers County seem eerily similar to problems reported yesterday on social media from people who also experienced problems when voting a ""straight republican ticket."" 

The following report also surfaced in Arlington, Texas from a person who voted a straight republican ticket only to find just before submitting her ballot that her presidential choice had been switched to Clinton/Kaine . After reporting the error to polling officials, the voter was told that these errors ""had been happening."" 

This Reddit user also noted multiple reports of voting errors across the state of Texas. 

Of course, the real question is how many people submitted erroneous ballots before this ""glitch"" was caught and how many other ""software glitches"" exist in other counties around the country that will never be caught?",english,2016-10-26T22:45:13.290+03:00,blacklistednews.com,US,93026,Texas County Enacts "Emergency Paper Ballots" After "Software Glitch" In Voting Machines,0,http://www.blacklistednews.com/images/blacklistednews-LOGO-c1.png,0,0,0,0,0,bs

It has been a harsh week for the 8,000 refugees inhabiting the Calais ""Jungle"" camp. 
Continuing an operation which began on Monday, workers ramped up demolition of France's notorious Calais ""Jungle"" on Wednesday after fierce blazes cut through a swathe of the camp overnight, sending migrants fleeing for safety. Fabienne Buccio, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said it was ""mission accomplished"" for the demolition. 
However his assessment may have been premature as charities said many unaccompanied minors had not been processed and BBC reporters at the camp said groups of adults remained. 
Wearing hardhats and orange overalls in the morning fog, a team of around 15 workers resumed tearing down tents and makeshift shelters at the camp that has become a symbol of Europe's migrant crisis. 
As recounted by AFP reporters, a new fire threw black smoke into the sky as several dozen wood shacks smouldered on a main thoroughfare of the sprawling slum. ""Someone burned our tents. Maybe they used petrol or something, I don't know, but the fires spread fast. We had to run out in the middle of the night,"" said Arman Khan, a 17-year-old Afghan. ""I left all my things behind, I have nothing now."" 
Riot police had cordoned off the demolition area while aid workers and government officials checked that the dwellings were empty. Others carted away the debris and abandoned belongings - mattresses, multi-coloured blankets, supermarket trollies and so on - in small earth-movers. Gas canisters, sinks, refrigerators and other metal objects lay scattered across the desolate scene. 
The fires spread just hours after workers moved in Tuesday to clear the squalid camp that has been home to an estimated 6,000-8,000 migrants, many with hopes of reaching Britain. 
A local official played down the blazes, telling AFP: ""It's a tradition among communities who set fire to their homes before leaving."" Located next to the port of Calais, the Jungle has for years been a launchpad for migrants attempting to make it to Britain by sneaking onto trucks or jumping onto trains heading across the Channel. 
Since Monday, 3,242 adults have been transferred to centres around France and 772 unaccompanied minors have been moved to shipping containers converted into temporary shelters in the Jungle, the interior ministry said. The numbers represent around half the camp's estimated population before the operation began, according to official figures. 
The authorities have said those who agree to be moved can seek asylum in France. Those who refuse risk deportation. The fate of more than 1,000 unaccompanied minors is of particular concern. 
Meanwhile, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Tuesday that all those ""with proven family links in Britain"" would eventually be transferred and that London had committed to reviewing all other cases where it was ""in the child's interest"" to settle across the Channel.

However, not all are seeking to rush back. Many inhabitants of the camp attempted to break through the police line and storm back into the camp, which is being demolished by the authorities, according to RT's reporter on the ground.

A migrant child, who was among those returning to the camp, waved a cricket bat and shouted: “Jungle is not dead! Jungle is not dead!” according to the British Express newspaper. “It’s chaos with these ongoing fires and plumes of smoke [across the camp],” Harry Fear reported from the scene. 
“The police line was broken by migrants wanting to enter back in,” he said, adding that it appears new fires have been set across the camp. 
According to the RT correspondent, the operation to clear Calais looks much like a failure, despite claims of its complete success by the French authorities. He said that fire brigades on site have been working “quite slowly” to put out the fires. The RT crew also noticed “uncontrolled gas canisters [at the camp’s territory], which haven’t yet been secured by the authorities,” Fear added. 
According to an unnamed regional official, the authorities will be able to shut down the processing center, which is dispersing migrants to different locations in France until the end of the day. Fires keep burning in many locations around the camp as some migrants set fire to the camp in response to government actions.

The demolition of tents and wooden structures, which the residents had used as shelter, started at the site on Tuesday. Violent clashes between the police and the inhabitants were reported, with tear gas deployed by officers. The camp was set ablaze last night by refugees displeased with the demolition. The flames caused several explosions of portable gas, with four migrants arrested over the incident. Cette partie de la #Jungle a été rasée au tractopelle #Calais pic.twitter.com/somJBNNkKy

Thousands of hopeful migrants, many of whom are now homeless, are looking to cross the English Channel to find asylum in the UK have been holed up at the camp for months. Britain, however, only agreed to take in around 1,000 migrant children from the camp who have relatives in the UK. 
On Wednesday, almost 40 councils in England refused to accept any of the child refugees evacuated from the camp.

Recall that in a March 2015 interview with CBS, just after the NYT reported of Hillary's use of a private email server, president Obama told the American public he had only learned about Hillary's ""unusual"" arrangement from the press. 
As we further reminded readers one month ago, CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante asked Mr. Obama when he learned about her private email system after his Saturday appearance in Selma, Alabama. "" The same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,"" the president told Plante. "" The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived ,"" Mr. Obama said. ""I'm glad that Hillary's instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed."" 
Unfortunately, the ""transparency"" of the Obama administration was severely tarnished in late September , when in the FBI's interview notes with Huma Abedin released by the FBI it was first revealed that Obama had used a pseudonymous email account: ""Once informed that the sender's name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: 'How is this not classified?'"" the report says. ""Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president's use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email."" 
To be sure, this was not definitive evidence that Obama was aware of Hillary's email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the Clinton campaign. 
That changed today, however, when in the latest Podesta dump we learn that in an email from Cheryl Mills to John Podesta , the Clinton aide upon learning what Obama had just said... I have some questions here pic.twitter.com/ufkeoZCx2m

... countered with something quite stunning: 
we need to clean this up - he has emails from her - they do not say state.gov 
That, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the Clinton campaign. 
As a further reminder, Politico previously reported that the State Department had refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers cited the ""presidential communications privilege,"" a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. It is therefore unknown what the president's ""alternative"" email account was, or who hosted it. 
This also explains why in a prior Wikileak, Podesta told Mills in an email titled ""Special Category"" that she thinks "" we should hold emails to and from potus? That's the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will. "" Mills did not respond by email. 
The Clinton-Obama emails were turned over to the State Department, which later announced it would not release them. 
* * * 
So just how did Mills and Podesta ""clean up"" the fact that Obama lied to the American people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect Hillary Clinton. 
What we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between March 25-31, just a couple of weeks after Mills said ""we need to clean this up,"" Bleachbit was used to wipe Hillary's private server clean. But of course, that is purely a coincidence. 
Since we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of US government, or as Cheryl Mills dubbed it a ""clean up"", perhaps it is time for the State Depratment to unveil just what was said between the president and the Clinton campaign?

During a radio interview, comic legend and political pundit Jackie Mason joked that the only time Hillary Clinton is not lying “is when her mouth is not moving.” “And even then, she is probably lying because she’s probably sitting there thinking of the next lie she is going to tell,” he added.
 
Mason claimed that Clinton is so untrustworthy that she likely couldn’t land a job as an “attendant in the ladies’ room because they would be afraid that she would steal the towels or the napkins. Even the toilet paper wouldn’t be safe from her.”
Mason was speaking during his regular segment on this reporter’s talk radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and NewsTalk 990 AM in Philadelphia.
Listen to the interview here: 

He continued:
Do you think that if she went for any other job besides the presidency that anyone would hire her anywhere? If you saw her resume which is a resume of accomplishing nothing and running from the police three-quarters of her life. She is always either indicted or almost indicted or about to be indicted. Her whole life spent fleeing from the Justice Departments of different countries. Now, this yenta, do you think she would be able to get any other job? …
Would you think they would hire her as a chambermaid? Do you know what all those sheets and pillowcases are worth? Do you think they would trust her with it? After they found out the history of her life. Let’s be honest about it, if you went on a vacation would you let her watch your house while you went on vacation? Would you expect to come back and find anything still there?

26 Oct, 2016 26  
On Tuesday, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump received the endorsement of the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association in Miami, the first such endorsement in the history of the anti-communist group. “Our decision was a no-brainer,” a representative of the veterans group said in his introduction to the candidate, noting that the group had become increasingly concerned that “corruption in our public life has become rampant and has to be stopped,” and that they could not trust the “socialist progressive agenda of Hillary Clinton.”
 
“We only ask of Mr. Trump that the fundamental values animating his campaign – to restore truth and justice in our political system and public life – be deemed equally necessary for the oppressed people of Cuba in their struggle to be free,” he added.

Taking the podium to chants of “USA! USA!”, Trump said he was “humbled by this endorsement from true freedom fighters” and recognized the Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White), a Cuban dissident organization composed of the wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters of political prisoners. “They march quietly to church every Sunday and… are subject to physical and verbal violence and abuse by government-sanctioned mobs,” Trump noted, adding that Clinton “turns a blind eye to the human rights violations that occur every single day.”
Miami’s Bay of Pigs Museum is a spiritual home for the Brigada 2506, the official name of the Cuban freedom fighters who embarked on the mission to overthrow Castro in 1961. It features a wall commemorating the martyrs killed during the operation – including a number of non-Cuban American fighters – as well as a variety of memorabilia from both the operation and Cuban history generally, including a collection of the flags used throughout the island’s history.
Bay of Pigs veterans have nearly unanimously asserted that the mission to free Cuba failed because leftist icon president John F. Kennedy failed to provide the air support the group had been promised after the fighters had deployed. Air support was critical to the design of the military operation.

Trump’s visit highlights the largely adversarial relationship Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, have maintained with the Cuban exile community in the United States.
The Clinton presidency is stained with the blood of dozens of Cubans seeking freedom. Among them are the 41 killed in July 1994, when the Cuban government sunk the “March 13” tugboat , seeking to arrive in the United States. Cuban government officials killed ten children between the ages of 6 months and 12 years in that operation; the Clinton White House did not issue a significant response to this act.
In 1996, the Cuban government shot down two planes belonging to the Cuban exile group Brothers to the Rescue in international waters, killing four Cuban-Americans, including U.S. citizens. Bill Clinton said of the attack , “this shooting of civilian aircraft out of the air was a flagrant violation of international law. It is wrong and the United States will not tolerate it.” The Cuban government never faced trial for this violation, however, or significant repercussions for the act.
Towards the end of the Clinton tenure, in 2000, Clinton ordered the siege of a residential home in Miami, where Cuban exile child Elián González, 7 years old, was residing with his family. González was abducted from his home at gunpoint and returned to Cuba in an operation observers at the time described as “resembl[ing] Munich 1940 more than Miami 2000.”
González, now an adult, is a prominent communist propaganda figure .
Hillary Clinton herself has said that she supports President Barack Obama’s concessions to the Castro regime announced on December 2014. While she was no longer his Secretary of State at the time, she took credit for his Cuba policies in her autobiography, Hard Choices . Since the Obama concession package, both violent arrests of dissidents and dangerous attempts to flee Cuba for the United States via the Caribbean Sea have skyrocketed.
A series of releases of emails from the organization Wikileaks shows that Clinton insiders, including campaign chairman John Podesta, are intimately acquainted with advocates for furthering business ties and emboldening the Castro regime, and that these advocates have influences Clinton’s public statements on the issue.

26 Oct, 2016 26  
(REUTERS) U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Democrat Hillary Clinton’s plan for Syria would “lead to World War Three,” because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear-armed Russia.
 
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.
…
“What we should do is focus on ISIS. We should not be focusing on Syria,” said Trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his Trump National Doral golf resort. “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.

Whether or not you’re a basketball fan, you’re going to love this story about a bold new humanitarian initiative from the NBA. In order to help alleviate the refugee crisis in Europe, the league is housing Syrian refugees on whichever half of the court isn’t being played on during the game. 
Now that’s making a difference. Way to go, NBA! 
Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, millions of Syrians have been displaced. But thanks to the generosity of the NBA, some of them will now find a new home right around the three-point line on the half of the court that isn’t being played on at that time. While players occupy one half of the court, Syrian refugees will have a safe and welcoming space on the other half to reassemble their lives until the ball changes possession and they are shuttled to the opposite end. 
Wow. What a beautiful gesture from the NBA! With 29 courts across the country and 82 games in the 2016-2017 season, the league is set to provide housing that periodically oscillates from one half of the court to the other for several thousand Syrian refugees. This is huge. 
In contrast to Europe’s notoriously overcrowded refugee camps, the NBA’s half courts are big enough to comfortably house at least five families around the perimeter and one or two in the paint. The refugees also have access to any snack vendors who happen to be milling about the crowd near whichever half of the court they’re on at the time. 
Of course, it’s a new program, and it’s not perfect. There have been several incidents in which refugees have collided with players after failing to get to the other half of the court in time, and last night an 8-year-old Syrian girl had to be treated for minor injuries after LeBron James dunked on her during a fast break. 
Still, according to NBA commissioner Adam Silver, the program is a huge step up from the refugee camps abroad. 
“The Syrian refugee crisis is only getting worse. Meanwhile, we’ve got this half of the court that isn’t being played on just collecting dust waiting to be put to good use,” said Silver, adding that he felt the league had a moral responsibility to harbor the refugees. “If we can help these people by sheltering them on one side of the court until there’s a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half as soon as there’s a change in possession and then sheltering them on the other half until there’s a change in possession, then we have an obligation to do that.” 
It’s refreshing to see a major organization like the NBA reaching out to a group of people who so desperately need our help right now.

In an age where information can be spread to millions of people within seconds, it’s often difficult to separate fact from fiction. That was certainly the case a few months ago when a controversial photo of President Obama began to circulate online, with many insisting that the image was the real, unedited deal. But today that picture was officially debunked: The photo of Obama with a speech balloon saying “Islam is my main thing” has been proven to be doctored. 
Wow. This is a good reminder to take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt! 
Take a look at the photo in question above. In it, you can clearly see Obama proudly declaring his unshakeable Islamic faith. 
At first glance, the photo looks like pretty clear evidence that Obama may be Muslim and confirms the suspicions of his most far-right critics, who insist the president has been dishonest with the public about his true religious beliefs. But when the image went viral on Twitter, one user pointed out a possible sign of doctoring: 
Many users agreed that the photo appeared to have been manipulated in some way and asked for an expert to weigh in. A graphic designer named Brendan McCann, whose Twitter bio says he’s been in the industry for over a decade, quickly answered the call. 
But it was Snopes that officially put the matter to rest. After scouring the internet far and wide, they were able to dig up the original version of the photograph, taken during one of the president’s official White House photo ops, and there’s no speech balloon upholding the teachings of the Quran anywhere in sight. 
Take a look at the two images side by side to see how the effect was achieved: 
Well, there you have it. It looks like whoever made this image took some of the space from above the president’s head and used it to overlay the speech balloon on top. It’s a powerful effect, but it’s definitely not real.

This is a question I have been asking myself repeatedly over the past few weeks. The 2016 presidential election is but a few weeks away and I am left feeling confused, disgusted, and outright angry at what has been demonstrated as leadership. If I am honest, I feel embarrassed to be a citizen of a country that is most certainly causing many eyes to roll and jokes to be made.   We are better than this. As I continue to grow, fall down, pick myself back up, and evolve as a leader, I am constantly exploring what the word means to me and how I can embody that meaning from a grounded and heart-centered place. I come back time and time again to the same process — a process that is not weighted or influenced by that which is outside of me, but rather by that which lives deep inside of me. It’s about self-inquiry, self-reflection, self-accountability, and self-responsibility. It’s a process that asks me to drop to my knees, to stretch, to get uncomfortable, to ask more of myself. It’s a process that in times like these, we uncompromisingly appoint ourselves to undergo because we have no choice but to stand firmly in our own leadership. Whether you are a butcher, baker, or a candlestick maker — you are a leader. And the world needs as many honest, honourable, and integrity-filled leaders as it can get right now. Here are my six strategies for stepping firmly into your own embodied leadership. I invite you to get comfy with a notebook, pen, and cup of warm tea and walk yourself through this process step-by-step. 1. Identify Your Value System What matters most to you? Where do you feel unwilling to compromise? Your integrity? Loyalty? Ambition? Transparency? Your values are the foundational parts of yourself that guide your behaviours, choices, and actions. When these are in alignment and you are living your values, you feel at peace inside of yourself. You are operating not from your head or your gut, but from your heart. You are discerning in your decisions and steadfast in your commitments. Not only does it feel good inside of yourself, it is overwhelmingly obvious to the outside world that you’ve got something groovy going on.   2. Acknowledge and Understand What Makes You, You I hope this step doesn’t scare you, because this one takes a little bit of work, as it is an ongoing unfolding process. Although many of us know parts of ourselves, we also have blind spots. Part of stepping into your leadership is to see and understand all of yourself: the good, the bad, and the ugly. For me, the most helpful resource I have found is the Enneagram . This highly evolved personality typing system helps you to better understand your strengths, your stressors, your fears, your areas for growth, and your opportunities to develop. Using this system, you can become clearer on who you are, while learning how other people operate in the world. This information can be unbelievably helpful when learning how to be mindful and aware as a leader. As an Enneagram Type 2, the Healer, I am well-versed in knowing that my superpower is my ability to be compassionate, empathetic, and helpful, but I also lose my power and can become insecure when I do not feel needed. This does not make me weak or invaluable as a leader, but rather pushes me to rise up and push my edges whenever I experience this feeling so that I can meet my own boundless potential. 3. Cultivate a Network of Mentors Want to know something crazy? You don’t know everything and you can’t do it all on your own. I know how disappointing this may sound, but let me tell you something: It’s a damn godsend! Not needing to know it all or have all of the answers gives you space to be vulnerable, approachable, real, and ever-changing. A network of mentors helps you to not feel alone when you are up against the wall and aren’t quite sure how to navigate your next steps. Over the past few years I have worked hard to create my network of mentors. Currently, my network consists of one spiritual mentor and two professional mentors. Oh, and I also have a therapist. That’s right, I have four older, wiser, more evolved humans in my life that I can regularly call upon when in need. And they aren’t my friends. I don’t call them to gab, or simply catch up. I call them when I need to get in deep and unpack some serious personal, professional, or spiritual shit. This wolf pack is a group of individuals who have been around the sun once or twice and take their role as a mentor seriously. If you are feeling lost or misguided in your leadership, I greatly encourage you to reach out to people who inspire you and are living and leading lives that you admire. Don’t be shy. Don’t hold back. Be willing to pay a bit of money for it. Be willing to be rejected. But most of all, be willing to ask. 4. Act from Authenticity A few months back I wrote an article about my 5 Tips on Being Genuine . It almost makes me laugh to think that we need to be reminded to be authentic in our actions. However, the truth is that we have become used to cropping our lives into a series of photographs, 140 characters, or neat blog entries and Facebook posts. We have become buttoned up, edited, and the image of perfection. So, let me show you my leadership by revealing some of my imperfections. I often have no idea what I’m doing. I felt sad for almost all of last week and I couldn’t totally put my finger on why or what to do other than get lots of sleep, exercise, and eat well. I have lots of little blonde hairs on my upper lip that I pluck when I remember. Sometimes I watch TV on my computer in bed. Other times I eat peanut butter toast and scrambled eggs for dinner when I feel too wiped out to cook. I’ve been called bossy. My boyfriend and I fight. I can get anxious when work is slow. Evolve Your Inbox & Stay Conscious Daily Inspiration and all our best content, straight to your inbox. Writing these words, I can feel my own power grow. I’m not hiding anything. I’m not putting on a face or trying to be put together; I’m just being human. And whenever I read or watch someone else show me their messiness, I feel their power and their leadership. Being human is sexy. Show the world what you’re working with. 5. Constantly Work on Your Communication Skills Let me repeat this one: CONSTANTLY WORK ON YOUR COMMUNICATION SKILLS. Communication is a basic life skill and your ability to communicate largely determines your happiness. When you communicate effectively, you make and keep friends. You are valued at work. Your family respects and trusts you. Your needs get met. When you communicate effectively, people listen and hear you, and you learn how to listen to and hear other people. This is when magic happens. Strong, compassionate communication is something that is learned; you’re not born with it. If you are looking for resources on how to better communicate, I highly recommend the books Messages: The Communication Skills Book by Matthew McKay, Martha Davis, and Patrick Fanning and Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life by Marshall B. Rosenberg. Additionally, be open to uncovering the underlying reasons of why you react or feel triggered (another blog post coming soon on that) by certain types of communication as well as receiving feedback from others on ways that you communicate well and areas for growth. 6. Commit Yourself to Lifelong Learning Whether you are a CEO at a company, a full-time parent, a caretaker, just starting out your career, or saving the world, you are a leader. And any truly great leader is always learning. Leaders are strengthening their strengths, finding opportunity in their obstacles, and discovering new ways to be the best versions of themselves. Whether it is a book, workshop, therapy session, class, or travel experience, commit yourself to a lifelong learning process and you will forever feel empowered in your leadership. We are currently witnessing a national crisis, where the proposed future leaders of our country are being caught in webs of lies, immoral behaviours, cruel words, disrespectful communication, and dishonourable action. I know it’s easy to sit here, pointing fingers and placing blame. Instead, I am asking you to rise up and embrace your own, unique, and powerful leadership so that we can all come together, one by one, and stand up for what we believe in. Truth. Peace. Integrity. Compassion. Equality. Loyalty. Honesty. And Love. If you are doing it right, you will feel like you are revealing too much.

But the light doesn’t turn off or adjust according to the hour of the day; it’s continually emitted, not only by our smartphones, but by our laptops, televisions, and other devices as well. The problem is that this light, which mimics the brightness of the sun, confuses your brain into thinking it’s daytime, even during the dead of night. This in turn stops your brain from releasing melatonin, the hormone which induces sleep, and prevents you from falling asleep. This is why experts recommend to turn off all screens at least two hours before bed.   Melatonin is released by a tiny organ in your brain called the pineal gland a couple of hours prior to sleep. The science of why the blue light emitted by mobile devices keeps people awake has led to the discovery of a photoreceptor called Melanopsin. Though we’ve long been familiar with the various cones and rods that construct our vision, Melanopsin was discovered recently in retinal ganglion cells, which are sensitive to blue light. Since then, experimental research has found that the average person using mobile devices before bed may have difficulty falling and/or staying asleep. The impact of blue light is even more significant for teenagers, who are more vulnerable to the effects of light than adults. This is because circadian rhythm naturally shifts during adolescence, causing teenagers to feel more awake late into the night. Starting up a video game or television show just before bedtime could be enough to push sleepiness away for another hour or two, making early mornings particularly difficult. Blue Light Isn’t The Only Concern Dr. Martin Blank from the Department of Physiology and Cellular Biophysics at Colombia University has joined a group of scientists from around the world who are making an international appeal to the United Nations regarding the dangers associated with various electromagnetic emitting devices, like cellphones and WiFi.

In China, screen addiction is actually considered a clinical disorder, and as a result a number of rehabilitation centres have been established where young people addicted to screens are completely isolated from all media. Although the success of these treatment centres has yet to be established, their necessity paints a dark picture of the technological age in which we live. ( source )   What You Can Do The first thing you can do is limit your screen time before bed, turning all screens off at least two hours before you plan to fall asleep. This is the perfect time to catch up on your reading. You can also download an app called f.lux, which adjusts the colour of your computer’s display to the time of day — warm at night and brighter during the day — and cuts the blue light being emitted. There are similar apps for phones as well. All of us here at CE use these apps and have really noticed an improvement in our sleep quality. HERE is a page from their website that provides more research into what staring at screens can do to your sleep, as well as the science behind the f.lux app. Regardless of whether you are worried about your sleep, we can all benefit from a daily break from our smartphones and other screens.

EPIDEMIC - Black Barth,2016-10-26T22:36:00.000+03:00,Comment on The Creative Gifts Of ADHD: Disorder Or Gift? Real Or Fictitious? by A.D.H.D. NATION: HOW BIG PHARMA CREATED THE A.D.H.D. EPIDEMIC - Black Barth,"Approximately 11% of children 4-17 years of age (6.4 million) have been diagnosed with ADHD as of 2011. The percentage of children with an ADHD diagnosis continues to increase, from 7.8% in 2003 to 9.5% in 2007 and to 11.0% in 2011. Rates of ADHD diagnosis increased an average of 3% per year from 1997 to 2006 [Read article] and an average of approximately 5% per year from 2003 to 2011. Boys (13.2%) were more likely than girls (5.6%) to have ever been diagnosed with ADHD. The average age of ADHD diagnosis was 7 years of age, but children reported by their parents as having more severe ADHD were diagnosed earlier. Prevalence of ADHD diagnosis varied substantially by state, from a low of 5.6% in Nevada to a high of 18.7% in Kentucky. What Exactly Are We Dealing With Here? One big problem we are dealing with is the label of ADHD itself. By simply treating characteristics of ADHD as a disability (something we so commonly see in education) we are destroying the potential and self esteem of so many children. Diagnosing a child with a mental disorder based on their lack of ability and/or desire to pay attention in a classroom seems absurd, doesn’t it? In fact, in my opinion it’s down right crazy. Not wanting to, or not having the ability to pay attention to information that does not nourish the soul, spark the heart or capture the mind is in no way characteristic of a mental disability, but something that seems completely normal. Perhaps we should stop looking at the student and focus more on the environment we surround our children with? If it’s not stimulating enough for some students, that does not mean they have a mental disorder and should be given harmful medications. Some of these children will be in their own world and downright refuse to pay attention, trying to amuse themselves any way they possibly can, doing what they want to do and not what others tell them to do. These children have become targets for pharmaceutical companies and targets for what might very well be a false labeling campaign based on very little science. Characteristics associated with ADHD are in no way a “disability.” In fact, there is evidence to suggest that these characteristics might be more associated with “abilities” that should be placing many of these children in gifted school programs instead of special education programs. Unfortunately, new data from the National Center for Learning Disabilities shows that only 1 percent of students who receive services for their apparent “learning disabilities” (some of which are completely and unquestionably valid) are enrolled in gifted or talented programs. The report concluded that “students with learning and attention issues are shut out of gifted and AP programs, held back in grade level and suspended from school at higher rates than other students.” ( 1 ) This is a pretty disturbing characteristic, and what makes it even more disturbing is the fact that recent work in cognitive neuroscience shows that both creative thinkers, and those with an ADHD diagnosis show difficulty in suppressing brain activity that comes from the “ Imagination Network .” ( 2 )( 3 ) There are no school assessments that provide evaluation on creativity and imagination, these are hard to draw up and measure and receive very little attention in our education systems.   In fact, something that’s touched upon in the paragraph below, a tremendous amount of research shows that people who show characteristics of ADHD are more likely to reach higher levels of creative thought and achievement compared to those who don’t show these characteristics.( 4 )( 5 )( 6 )( 7 )( 8 )( 9 ) Research also shows that these characteristics are associated with the broadening of attention, and those who have them tend to have a mental “filter.” In other words, it’s their choice what they chose to give their attention to, and they are very selective and stern when it comes to that. Scott Barry Kaufman, the Scientific Director of The Imagination Institute in the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania says that : “Of course, whether this is a positive thing or a negative thing depends on the context. The ability to control your attention is most certainly a valuable asset; difficulty inhibiting your inner mind can get in the way of paying attention to a boring classroom lecture or concentrating on a challenging problem. But the ability to keep your inner stream of fantasies, imagination, and daydreams on call can be immensely conducive to creativity. By automatically treating ADHD characteristics as a disability– as we so often do in an educational context– we are unnecessarily letting too many competent and creative kids fall through the cracks.” ( source ) Another interesting piece of information to note is that in 2004, an author by the name of Gary Davis reviewed a large portion of literature from 1961 to 2003 and identified 22 recurring personality traits of creative people, most of which were very positive and associated with the same personality traits as people who have been diagnosed with ADHD. Some of these traits included: independence, risk taking, high energy, curiosity, humor, emotional and artistic. Some of the negative ones included: impulsive, argumentative and hyper active. He published his findings in his book “ Creativity is Forever .” It’s not the children, they do not have a disability of any kind. They simply have a different way of learning, and with a lack of differentiated instruction in modern day education systems, having a child spend 8 hours a day in such a non-stimulating environment is wrong. The solution isn’t feeding our children drugs that have been proven to be extremely harmful in multiple ways so that a child is almost forced to pay attention and listen, but rather changing the environment that surrounds the student to make it more simulating and exciting. This is a tough task in modern day education, and something educational institutions struggle with on a daily basis. These children do not need to be singled out and labelled with something that might be completely fictitious. Is ADHD Even Real? When I was in school I received this diagnosis, alongside a learning disability and more. As a child I always knew I was perfectly fine, that everything I did and what I decided to pay attention to was simply my choice. I always felt that none of the labels and the explanations that accompanied them were valid at all, and I personally refused to take any medication that was being recommended to me. I am very glad I didn’t. 
I am also a qualified, certified teacher for grades 7-12. Through volunteer as well as work experience my views on this subject matter did not change at all, but strengthened. I have interacted with these children, as well as those within special education programs (with multiple “disabilities) and the way we label/view them is (in my opinion) completely 100 percent backwards and does nothing but harm. The labels and descriptions alone that education uses to define these kids is even worse. The fact that children who “have trouble” paying attention to what they are not interested in are diagnosed and placed into the disability category simply based on observation alone is a frightening thought, and I am glad I’m not the only one who has asked this question. There are many examples, and one of the most recent comes from Neurologist Dr Richard Saul. Richard Saul is a neurologist who has had a long career in examining patients who have been having trouble with short attention spans and an inability to focus. From his first hand experience, he feels that ADHD is nothing more than a fake disorder that is really only an umbrella of symptoms and not actually a disease. He strongly feels that it should not be listed as a separate disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic & Statistical Manual. You can read more about that here . “We have a habit of always seeing issues in people who don’t fit in with the system. Whether they don’t want to be in standard education, don’t want to work their whole lives or have trouble focusing on things they don’t like, we tend to label this as a problem, but is it? Maybe we just don’t look within enough to figure out what might really be going on or why we are living the way we do. Perhaps it is time we let go of the idea of having to “fit in” to something that doesn’t resonate rather than labelling it as a disorder.”– Joe Martino, Founder of Collective Evolution. It’s also important to note that, according to an article written in the The German Weekly, the founding father of ADHD, American psychiatrist Leon Eisenberg in a death bed interview said that “ADHD is a prime example of a fictitious disease.” The article was written by Der Spiegel and has made its way around the web for years. I cannot however completely verify that this statement was actually true. (10) It’s also important to note the pharmaceutical drug aspect into this equation. For (one small out of many) example(s), American psychologist Lisa Cosgrove and others investigated Financial Ties between the Diagnostic and Statistical Manuel of Mental Disorders (DSM) panel members and the pharmaceutical industry . They found that, of the 170 DSM panel members 95 (56%) had one or more financial associations with companies in the pharmaceutical industry. One hundred percent of the members of the panels on ‘mood disorders’ and ‘schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders’ had financial ties to drug companies. The connections are especially strong in those diagnostic areas where drugs are the first line of treatment for mental disorders. In the next edition of the manual, it’s the same thing. ( 11 )( 12 ) “The DSM appears to be more a political document than a scientific one. Each diagnostic criteria in the DSM is not based on medical science. No blood tests exist for the disorders in the DSM. It relies on judgments from practitioners who rely on the manual.” (11) – Lisa Cosgrove, PhD, Professor of Counseling and School Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. The very vocabulary of psychiatry is now defined at all levels by the pharmaceutical industry,” Dr. Irwin Savodnik, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California at Los Angeles ( source ) There is lots of evidence to suggest that Pharmaceutical companies have influenced certain psychiatrists to “pathologize” certain behavior as a mental illness so more drugs can be marketed to the masses. In my opinion the evidence is overwhelming, but we’ll save that for another article as it is a big topic. There are lots of things to consider when it comes to ADHD, and the content of this article is just the beginning. What are your thoughts on ADHD?

Reagan won so big that Carter even conceded the election before California was counted. The moral of the story, it ain’t over til it’s over — and it’s definitely not over yet. It wasn’t in 1980 and it isn’t today in 2016. 
The mainstream media wants Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to win, there’s no doubt about it. WikiLeaks released emails from the account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman, and one of those emails even discussed the use of “oversampling” to rig the polls . Advertisement - story continues below 
Oversampling is a tactic where more of a certain group is polled — such as more Democrats than Republicans — in an effort to sway the results. 
This isn’t anything new, but the concrete evidence of it out of the horse’s mouth is huge. For the Clinton campaign to admit the use of this biased and dirty tactic in an email is something people should remember every time the media trots out a poll. 
As Ann Coulter noted in her book “ Slander ,” the liberal media has used rigged polls to sway public opinion for years. This election isn’t the first time and, sadly, it won’t be the last. 
The mainstream media is massively biased , and their polls are often rigged. Keep Reagan’s 1980 landslide win in mind over the next two weeks — and ignore the games being played by the media.

Despite what the media might want you to think, there are a fair number of blacks who support Trump . In fact, The Gateway Pundit reported that a series of polls indicated that Trump may receive more black votes than any GOP presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1960. 
If the liberal media actually did their job correctly, we wouldn’t even be hearing about this non-issue. Instead, because they are so desperate to avoid talking about the WikiLeaks emails that are hurting Clinton’s campaign, they will look for anything to distract the American people.

That case had accused him of using unconstitutional methods to crack down on illegal immigrants in and around the Phoenix area, and he had been ordered to cease and desist from those activities by a federal judge. 
If convicted, Arpaio could serve up to six months in jail, though the conviction would not necessarily bar him from continuing to hold a political office. A trial date for the contempt charge has been scheduled for Dec. 6. 
Arpaio’s lawyer, Mel McDonald, stated that the charge would be contested, saying, “We believe that when the final chapter is written, he will be vindicated.” Advertisement - story continues below 
McDonald added that it was unlikely that Arpaio would actually be arrested and compelled to have mugshots taken, and said the sheriff intended to plead not guilty. 
This is not the first time that Arpaio has run afoul of the Obama administration, and should Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton be elected, it is a near certainty that her administration would place the sheriff near the top of their target list to be taken out one way or another as well. 
Arpaio’s campaign released a statement on the matter, specifically noting the timing and political nature of the charge coming so close to the election. 
“The Obama Justice Department continues its efforts to influence the election for sheriff of Maricopa County. The department’s actions in the last 30 days before the election are further attempts to sabotage Sheriff Arpaio in his bid for a seventh unprecedented term as Maricopa County Sheriff,” read the campaign’s statement.

Sent by the Democrat candidate’s top aide Huma Abedin five months before Podesta asked about Clinton’s head, this email read as follows: “She’s going to stick to notes a little closer this am, still not perfect in her head.” 
As with Podesta’s email, Abedin’s may have been referring to a simple headache, or she could have meant that Clinton couldn’t get the text of her message “in her head.” Again, however, the evidence suggested otherwise. Advertisement - story continues below 
Critics have quite reasonably questioned Clinton’s health during this election season because of her persistent coughing fits and haggard look. Moreover, she was observed nearly collapsing to the ground during a Sept. 11 memorial event in New York City. 
Specifically, a video recorded from the event showed her propped up on a barrier, trying to remain upright as her security phalanx prepared to help her into her van. 
As Clinton began walking toward the van, however, she began stumbling. Her campaign later first blamed this behavior on dehydration but subsequently attributed it to pneumonia . 
Combined, both the email revelations and the Democrat candidate’s behavior have led many critics to speculate on her health, with some going so far as to claim that she suffers from Parkinson’s disease or a similar ailment.

Trump has gained the support of many who understand that Democrats have never actually followed through on their promises. They have little to show for supporting liberals but more strife and tension from a black president who promised hope and change. 
Moreover, President Barack Obama has done more to increase racial tension in this country than anyone could have guessed. Many black voters understand that, and they do not see Clinton as someone they can trust to change it. 
Trump has suggested that Democrats have done nothing to help black communities and has pointed out that they often suffer the most from a breakdown of law and order.

Trump had already anticipated the criticism the media was going to have in advance, and parried back: “If I said that, they’d say: ‘He’s violent. How could he have done that,’” Trump told the crowd in reference to Biden’s comments. 
The he cleverly pivoted to his actual opponent in the 2016 election. 
“Let’s knock out Hillary Clinton,” he said. “She’s as crooked as a three-dollar bill.” Advertisement - story continues below",english,2016-10-26T21:03:45.250+03:00,conservativetribune.com,US,486,Trump Says He’d Love to Take on Biden in Literal DC Beatdown,0,http://static.conservativetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/biden-trump.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Why, West wondered, would any sane citizen risk his or her life to serve in a military system so corrupt and backward that it would make its veterans pay back their rightfully earned bonuses? 
What made this move by the Pentagon even more unsettling was how much money it had frivolously wasted on other things that the colonel believed did not deserve to be funded.

Around Aug. 12, West Hollywood, California 
On the night of a rally, Tim Treadstone and other Trump supporters were denied access at a popular Mexican restaurant. Other customers began throwing food and screaming at the group. 
During the rally, “a can of Monster energy drink, eggs and dog feces were also thrown at pro-Trump demonstrators.”

An assailant attacked a 62-year-old man wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt. 
“The motorist inquired why (the man) was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him,” a police spokesman stated. “The (victim) continued to walk away as (the) motorist followed him.” 
The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs.

A breakdown of that poll showed Trump with an advantage over Clinton among independent voters, a shift from the 2012 election in which President Barack Obama won the state by garnering more support from independents than GOP challenger Mitt Romney. 
In Ohio, a poll by Axiom Strategies and the Remington Research Group showed Trump leading Clinton by a score of 46-42. Advertisement - story continues below 
Again, Trump won out over Clinton among independent voters by a margin of 4 points and was showing significant support among voters in cities such as Cincinnati, Dayton and Toledo. Trump and Clinton were essentially tied in the cities of Youngstown, Cleveland and Columbus. 
Another surprise from the Ohio poll was the breakdown of support for the candidates by gender, which seemed to show that Clinton’s alleged massive lead among women has all but vanished, at least in the Buckeye State. 
Female respondents to the poll preferred Clinton to Trump by only 2 points, 45-43. Meanwhile, Trump continued to dominate among male voters, leading his opponent by 13 points, 51-38. 
Of course these numbers could still change over the course of the next two weeks, but far from showing the race to be essentially over already, they instead reveal that Trump has a pretty decent shot at winning two of the most important states when all the votes have been counted after Nov. 8.

On both sides of the Atlantic, a battle is underway between largely discredited “elites” and sometimes disreputable “nationalists,” a conflict over un-kept promises about the future and unsettling memories of the past, writes Andrew Spannaus. 
By Andrew Spannaus 
In recent years “nationalism” has become a bad word in Europe, a synonym of closure, racism and wars. Over the past 20-25 years European elites have instead embraced a concept of globalization based on a world without economic, physical and social borders. 
This view assumes the gradual affirmation of a set of shared values internationally, consisting of human rights and economic freedom, that however much the remaining closed, autocratic regimes may try, will inevitably become the standard for the entire world. Flag of the European Union. 
It is essentially the argument put forward by Francis Fukuyama in “The End of History:” liberal democracy and free markets have won the ideological war, and represent the culmination of human evolution. 
The political events of 2016 are upending this view of the globalization of human rights and economic liberalism. The American electorate has supported a series of outsiders – most notably Donald Trump, who has run his campaign in direct opposition to the U.S. political and financial class, invoking economic protectionism and a stronger national identity. 
Against expectations, the population of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, marking an irreparable break in the supposedly inevitable process of European unification. And across Europe support is growing for more extreme, anti-system political forces, that threaten not only to withdraw from the common currency – the Euro – but also to seal the borders in response to economic and security threats associated with immigration. 
Establishment’s Failure 
It is no exaggeration to speak of the failure of the entire transatlantic political establishment. Since the 1970s, Western economies have undergone a post-industrial transformation that has favored short-term gain over long-term investment. The notion of economic freedom has translated principally into support for deregulation and speculative finance. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is welcomed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Federal Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, on April 14, 2011. [State Department photo/ Public Domain Central Banks have made unlimited resources available to the financial sector while large areas of the real economy struggle to survive, feeding discontent among the population. It is true that new economic sectors have arisen, along with widespread changes made possible by technologies that were inconceivable until a few years ago, but the overall effect has been to hollow out the middle class and create large-scale income equality.
In Europe, the principal vehicle of this process has been the economic policy of the European Union. From the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, European nations have been stuck in a monetary straitjacket, that prevents governments from taking effective economic action. In the name of market principles, liberalization has been implemented that favors large financial interests while lowering standards of living for the middle class. 
Countries are constitutionally required to move towards a balanced budget, with the European Commission and the European Central Bank essentially having veto power over national policies. This has translated into harsh austerity, including the massive budget cuts and tax increases inflicted on countries such as Greece, Spain and Italy in recent years. 
Despite paying lip service to the need for change, the economic and political elites have refused to abandon this approach, that not only ignores the suffering of the population, but actually makes the problem worse. In fact the austerity causes a drop in economy activity and thus exacerbates budget problems, leading to a vicious cycle that Europe seems unable to stop. 
A Big Backlash 
The resulting backlash is calling into question the process of European integration as a whole, provoking a strenuous defense by the elite of institutions that are said to have guaranteed “50 years of peace” after the Second World War. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads “Vote Trump” on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) 
It is true, of course, that there are some benefits to E.U. integration, and that nobody wants to return to a situation of conflict among the member states. But the current policies are quite different than the fruitful cooperation that existed until the 1990s, when the financial elite began its move to exert supranational control. 
Now, the failed economic policies of the past 20 years are no longer sustainable. Governments are forced to negotiate over .1 percent of the budget deficit with the bureaucracy in Brussels, while the need for public and private investment runs in the trillions. 
The pro-finance, anti-production policies must change not for ideological reasons or to serve some specific interest group; they must change because there is no other choice. People are revolting against a political class that does not respond adequately to widespread economic and social discontent. In times of economic distress the population becomes more vulnerable to demagogues, raising the risk of dangerous outcomes, as seen with Fascism and Nazism in the 1920s and 1930s. 
Currently, there are unprepared and unpredictable political forces with growing support across Europe, that in some cases represent a threat to the democratic rights and values that the European Union aims to promote. Defending the orthodoxy of E.U. policy against popular movements that target failed economic policies, will only further damage precisely those values on which Europe is said to stand. 
What to Do 
At this point Europe needs a return to measures that promote productive investment and innovation, rather than cut social welfare programs and encourage further deregulation. Refugees from Mideast wars camped along rail lines in Greece. 
There are two potential directions: a wholesale change in the policies of the E.U. institutions, without modifying their essential structure, or a step back from the process of cancellation of national sovereignty. 
The first option seems unrealistic, for various reasons. These include the constitutional nature of many economic and budget constraints, and the stubbornness demonstrated by the European ruling class in recent years; a class that, despite numerous alarm bells, does not at all seem ready to abandon an elitist view of globalization. 
The response to the Brexit vote is a glaring example. Representatives of the E.U. institutions lashed out with arrogance and bitterness, essentially accusing half of the British population of being ignorant, racist and isolationist. It’s a comforting excuse based on partial truths, that avoids reflection on Europe’s own mistakes. 
At this point a return of decision-making power to national governments is becoming inevitable: not in order to stop international cooperation, or to reject shared values, but because the model pursued by the supranational institutions and their allies in the financial world has failed, and risks producing both serious internal conflicts, and unacceptable strategic failures in an increasingly complex world.

It is literally less than two weeks till the election. 
@Colonel-Gunter.Brumm has had a brilliant idea. For the remainder of the race we need to focus on one last Glorious Memetic Campaign. It should primarily be focused on social media for widest distribution. 
Specifically via a ‘NORMIE FRIENDLY’ assault. 
Our Orders: Add a shortcut to this article to your desktop. Check the BBS for great posts and send them out across your networks. Make a new folder on your desktop just for this campaign. Archive, create, distribute Go through ALL of your archives for the best memes you have. ONLY NORMIE FRIENDLY stuff. Anti Hillary and Glorious Trump stuff. NO Hakenkreuzes, chicken and watermelons or Daily Stormer watermarks, etc. Then assemble them all along with PNGs, blank backgrounds, finished products, etc so that we can mobilze and go full Klendathu Drop on her ass for the rest of the campaign. Because this is the ONLY TIME THAT COUNTS FOR MOST SHEEPLE. We need to reach the sheeple that we allÂ know personally and get them laughing, angry, emoting, etc. Deploy these normie friendly memes to flood your own personal social media, twitter etc. Put them into the hands of all of your colleagues at work, friends, relatives and their friends to flood the planet for the next 2 weeks. Again- NO Nazi stuff, just intense anti Hillary stuff right up to the edge of what we normally do and our best of the best Trump stuff we have. Make many posts, every day for the rest of the presidential campaign. Saturate all your networks (i.e. FB, Twitter etc.) Deploy all your accounts, IRLs, sockpuppets, etc. Reach out to other Alt-Right communities and have them join us. 
Check back here on this article every day to get more ammo and to leave more for others. 
Anyone that blocks you is a Hillary voter so don’t worry about them. Anyone that’s pro Trump will not block you and will share your stuff. Anyone undecided will read and can be swayed by the humor and horror and beauty of our memes. 
Remember this is about reaching the undecided, the fence sitters, the people who supported other candidates. The reason why they have to be specifically Normie friendly is so that everyone here feels comfortable enough to blast them into their own personal social networks. 
There are millions of us, blasting them into our networks extend their reach to billions. Stuff that your aunt and uncle can share with their friends too. We want them laughing and horrified. 
We think the best stuff to focus on is– Highlight her desire for war with Russia..– Highlight her corruption– Highlight Trump’s heroism and genius and glory– Highlight that all the smart and cool and sexy people support him. 
This is for real now. Get off your ass and do your duty for the Fatherland. 
To our Non American Brothers: This is your election too. The same orders apply. Help us so that we can help you. The US is the vampire heart of ZOG. If we bring it down here, you are free. Simple as that. 
Also here are some simple tools to make stuff and modify stuff you already like.

Donald Trumpâs star on the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame was destroyed early Wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker wielding a sledgehammer and pickax. The man, who told Deadline his name was Jamie Otis, said he was trying to extract the star to auction it off and raise funds for the women who have come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them over the decades. 
The embedded terrazzo and brass star, dedicated in 2007 in recognition of the now-GOP presidential candidateâs days as host of NBCâs The Apprentice, was smashed to bits, with shrapnel flying everywhere in the early-morning hours at the starâs sidewalk home at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. near the Dolby Theatre. Check out Deadlineâs exclusive video above. 
The incident occurred around 5:45 AM with a few bystanders stopping to watch. An LAPD police cruiser showed up around 6:15, but Otis already had left the scene. 
He wanted to give money to lying sluts. 
smdh. 
None of these stupid bitches have any evidence for their retarded claims. And they must have been put up to this by someone agreeing to pay their legal fees, because they’re all going to get sued, whether Trump wins or loses. 
And this man wants to give them free money. Just because. My princesses. 
The Evolutionary Roots of White-Knighting 
White-knighting has a biological explanation. Women have far more reproductive value than men do. And they are productive for a much shorter period of time. So a young fertile woman is of extreme value to the tribe, the nation, the race. This is why we all have these super-strong instincts to protect women. 
Technically, a society where the overwhelming majority of men had been killed, but the women were still alive, could recuperate. It takes a man five minutes to produce a child, while it takes a woman about three years (from conception to the point where it could exist without its mother). 
So, in a naturally functioning society, the white knight instinct is a good thing. 
However, we don’t live in naturally functioning society. We live in a totally jewed-out nightmare dystopia where nature itself has been turned on its head and women have been given authority to rule over men. We have also been systematically brainwashed to believe that women are the same as men, and thus possess a similar morality to men – for example, we are taught that women don’t lie constantly as a matter of course (they do), we are taught that they have the capacity to feel guilt (they don’t, they only feel shame) and we are taught that they can use logic to evaluate situations (they can’t). 
Basically, women do not have the physical strength to acquire necessary physical resources, so they have to use other methods to get what they need. 
Historically, though there was always a strong desire to protect women, women were not considered an authority on reality and there was an understanding that the basic biological nature of women is to survive on lies, manipulation and various schemes. So, while we would certainly hang a rapist if we found a rapist to have violently raped a woman, we didn’t take women at their word whenever they said anything. 
We also didn’t have these new forms of rape, such as “date rape.” If a woman went to the cops and said “I was in this man’s bedroom and he raped me,” the cops would say “well what were you doing in his room? Did he kidnap you?” 
We also would have been extremely skeptical of women accusing a rich man of sexual impropriety, as it is clear she has a whole lot to gain from doing so. 
So, even while the natural instinct is to come rushing in like a valiant knight whenever a woman cries that a man has disrespected her honor, this instinct was tempered by a logical understanding of the natural behavior of women. 
Another interesting element here worth noting is that while alpha males are much less prone to take the histrionics of women seriously, it is not because alpha males have less of a drive to protect women. It is because alpha males generally have more experience with women, and are thus much more likely to be aware of their tricks. Beta males also have the (presumably subconscious) belief that white-knighting will get them laid (protip: it does not), but this is also mainly due to a lack of understanding of female behavior due to a lack of exposure. 
There is also the fact that beta males have less testosterone, generally, and so are more likely to associate with females. You will notice that men who have “female friends” that they are not having sex with or trying to have sex with tend to be non-masculine. You also find this among men who will spend too much time with their girlfriends. 
Men who take the opinions of women seriously on any level whatsoever tend to exhibit signs of femininity. For masculine men, a woman expressing her opinion on anything is either cute or repulsive. 
Maximizing Male Exploitation 
Women instinctively understand this current backward situation, and are using it to maximum effect. Historically, women would have been ashamed to do what they are doing now. But because they know they can get away with it – and they know society won’t shame them – they are pushing it as far as they possibly can. 
And that is what we see with the Clinton campaign’s use of these “woman abuser” allegations against Trump. 
They are attacking both the male white-knight instinct, as we see this poor dumb bastard who smashed the star responding to, and they are attacking the instinct of women to unify as a collective group against men for their own protection (which is a separate phenomenon which I will go into another time – basically, women had to get along with each other in nature to raise each other’s kids, and they often used this unity amongst themselves as a lobbying bloc against the men of their tribe/clan/village). 
The psychological elements of this election are absolutely fascinating. But most people don’t understand psychology. If everyone understood psychology, then in some way, psychology itself would cease to exist, as we would all be perfectly rational robot-like beings.",english,2016-10-26T21:55:33.268+03:00,dailystormer.com,US,36674,Ultimate White Knight Destroys Trump’s Walk of Fame Star to Help Lying Slut Hoaxers,0,http://www.dailystormer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/daily-stormer_999460-614x330.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs

This is the only morality. 
Philippine Star : 
If his scathing and vulgar comments are causing consternation and worry among American investors and businessmen, President Duterte said yesterday they can always pack up and leave. 
Duterte was reacting to pronouncements from visiting US State Department Assistant Secretary Daniel Russel that his conflicting statements were causing jitters among US businessmen. 
âGo ahead. Pack your bags. We will sacrifice. We will recover, I assure you. We will live and survive. We have gone through the worst of times in this planet,â the President said in a press briefing at the NAIA Terminal 2 shortly before his departure for Japan. 
Russel on Friday said Duterteâs recent statements â especially his âseparationâ from the US â have ushered in a âclimate of uncertainty.â 
âThe succession of controversial statements, comments and a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippinesâ intentions have created consternation in a number of countries,â Russel told reporters Monday after meeting Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. in Manila. 
âNot only in mine and not only among governments, but also growing concern in other communities, in the expat Filipino community, in corporate boardrooms as well.â 
Duterte called the US official gago or stupid for asking him to tone down his anti-US rhetoric, saying it was Washington that started the rift between them. 
âI had a talk with Secretary Yasay and hereâs a guy his name is Russel, if you can just tone down our rhetoric. But I was not the one who started this rift. They are the ones who started it,â the President told reporters. 
He noted that during the campaign, Ambassador Philip Goldberg got his goat when the diplomat reacted to his joke about the rape-slay of an Australian missionary during a 1989 prison riot in Davao City. 
âRemember, it all started during the election. I made a comment in narration of an actual event which happened in Davao and which was covered by all media outlets there. The ambassador said something not very nice,â he pointed out. 
âYou are not supposed to do that because in an election of another country, you should be careful with your mouth,â he said, addressing Goldberg. 
KIKE Goldberg. 
In the final stretch of the campaign, Duterte joked about the rape and murder of Australian missionary Jacqueline Hamill during a prison riot. He said Hamill looked like an actress and as mayor âhe should have been first.â His remarks drew condemnation from several quarters, particularly womenâs groups. 
The rising death toll in the Duterte administrationâs war on drugs has sparked concerns among Western countries, particularly the US and the European Union. 
For Duterte, Russelâs statement was an insult. âI said donât do that to me. Every time they threaten us, including the EU (European Union), they think they are brighter than us,â Duterte said. 
âThen they will say âbe careful, we will put you in prison.â Son of a w***e. Go ahead.â 
Duterte maintained he would never be subservient to the interests of the US or any other foreign country. 
âYou know before we can move forward, Mr. America, there are things â so many things â the massacre of the Filipinos before. These are historical hurts that would never go away,â he said. He had earlier called the attention of the US to the massacre by its soldiers of hundreds of Muslims in the early 20th century. 
âI am not also a lapdog of any country. Only the Filipinos can treat me as a lapdog. Period. Nothing else. 
âDo not make us dogs. Do not. As if I am a dog with a leash and then you throw bread far away that I cannot reach.â 
Duterte had previously branded US President Barack Obama a âson of a b***hâ and told him to âgo to hell.â 
Duterte also hit Russel for supposedly being too nervous about his recent state visit to China. 
âNow, what did I tell to China? I went there, just being nice,â the President said. âI am just a small person. How can I cause distress? You are nervous because you are guilty.â 
Duterte said his state visit to China last week triggered a lot of speculations. 
âNapakabilis ng malisya ng mga gago (These fools were quick to think maliciously). We did not talk about anything in China except to cook siopao and chopsuey,â the President said in jest. 
Duterte also scored Goldbergâs statement that the US remains committed to defend the Philippines. 
âThere will be no wars anymore. Who will wage war with us? China? What will they get? Japan? What defense? They want to talk about the boogeyman war,â the President said. 
âStop that s**t. Nobody is interested in wars anymore. And if there is a fight, you fight your wars. Do not include mine.” 
Pure shitlordery. 
So great to see. 
And just for those who don’t get it: Duterte is not “anti-American,” he is anti-ZOGmerican. Filipinos have no problem with the American people, they have a problem with being slaves to international kike financial institutions and then, as already enslaved through massive debt programs and foreign ownership of infrastructure, being told by the Jew globalists that they’re not allowed to slaughter drug dealers because it’s mean. 
Duterte is doing what every leader should be doing by default: defending the people from enemies foreign and domestic.

NBC NY : 
The inbound upper level of the George Washington Bridge was closed by an immigrant rights protest on Wednesday morning, snarling traffic on one of the region’s most important crossings at the height of rush hour. 
Delays at the bridge for traffic heading into New York from New Jersey were up to nearly 90 minutes; traffic cameras showed bumper-to-bumper traffic barely inching along. 
The protesters apparently chained themselves across the roadway to block traffic, unfurling large banners in an attempt to spread their message. One banner appeared to read “Resist, Organized, Act Up!” 
Drivers were clashing with the protesters in an effort to get the bridge open, according to witnesses. Police quickly detained the small group and traffic began moving again about 15 minutes. 
The Port Authority said 10 people who were blocking the eastbound lanes were arrested. No injuries were reported.

Every cuck loser who enters Trump’s proximity turns into a mega-shitlord. 
Newt Gingrich just taught the slut Megyn [sic] Kelly how to shut her whore mouth. 
Wow. 
Washington Post : 
Gingrich, on Fox in his role as a Donald Trump surrogate, had questioned the stories of women whoâve come forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault â and the relative importance of the controversy itself, relative to Hillary Clintonâs alleged misdeeds. 
Kelly pushed back. âAs a media story, we donât get to say that 10 women are lying. We have to cover that story, sir,â said the Fox anchor. 
âSure. Okay,â Gingrich said. â So, so itâs worth 23 minutes of the three networks to cover that story, and Hillary Clinton had a secret speech in Brazil to a bank that pays her 225,000 [dollars], saying her dream is an open border where 600 million people could come to America â thatâs not worth covering âŚ â 
âThat is worth covering,â interjected Kelly. âAnd we did.â 
Gingrich was still speaking: â âŚ I mean, you want to go back through the tapes of your show recently, you are fascinated with sex, and you donât care about public policy. â 
âMe? Really?â she said, laughing. 
âWell, thatâs what I get out of watching you tonight,â Gingrich said. 
Cue crosstalk. 
KELLY: âYou know what, Mr. Speaker, Iâm not fascinated by sex. But I am fascinated by the protection of women âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and understanding what weâre getting in the Oval Office âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âOkay.â 
KELLY: â âŚ and I think the American voters would like to know âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âAnd, therefore, weâre going to send Bill Clinton back to the East Wing, because after all, you are worried about sexual predators.â 
âYeah, listen, itâs not about me,â Kelly said. âItâs about the women and men of America. And the poll numbers show us that the women of America, in particular, are very concerned about these allegations and, in large part, believe that they are a real issue. And donât dismiss the women âŚâ 
And: resume crosstalk. 
GINGRICH: âYou want to comment, you want to comment âŚâ 
KELLY: â âŚ donât dismiss the women summarily.â 
GINGRICH: â âŚ on whether the Clinton â do you want to comment on whether the Clinton ticket has a relationship to a sexual predator.â 
KELLY: âWe on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered that story as well, sir. I will tell you, the polls âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âNo, I just want to hear you use the words. I want to hear you use the words âBill Clinton, sexual predator.â I dare you. [At that point, Gingrich was smiling slightly. Kelly was not.] âSay âBill Clinton, sexual predator.ââ 
KELLY: âMr. Speaker, weâve covered â excuse me, sir âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Iowa, by the Arkansas bar.â 
KELLY: âExcuse me. excuse me.â 
GINGRICH: âDisbarred by the Arkansas bar. Eight hundred fifty thousand dollar penalty.â 
KELLY: â âŚ excuse me, sir. We on âThe Kelly Fileâ have covered the Clinton matter as well. Weâve hosted Kathleen Willey âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âWell, try saying it.â 
KELLY: â âŚ weâve covered the examples of him being accused as well, but heâs not on the ticket. And the polls also show that the American public is less interested âŚâ 
GINGRICH: âHeâll be in the, heâll be in the East Wing.â 
KELLY: â âŚ in the deeds of Hillary Clintonâs husband than they are in the deeds of the man who asks us to make him president, Donald Trump. Weâre going to have to leave it at that, and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them, Mr. Speaker. Thanks for being here.â 
GINGRICH: âAnd you, too.â 
I haven’t seen a bitch get shut down like this since the 80s. I thought he was going to reach through the screen and start slapping her around, OLD SCHOOL. 
I hate this bitch so, so much. 
She alone is proof that women should never, under any circumstances, be allowed to leave the kitchen or speak with men who are not their husbands, fathers or brothers. 
Because really, as funny as this exchange was, it isn’t really about sex. If it was about sex, as Newt mentions, she could easily focus on Bill, who is a literal rapist. 
It is about sexism.

Dr Matthew Raphael Johnson joins Matthew Heimbach for Wednsdayâs edition of The Daily Traditionalist to comment on geopolitics and starts by lamenting Albania being a member of NATO, when the country has no military force or hardware. Matt then brings us the news that a huge NATO force is amassing in the Baltics and Eastern Europe in the largest build up on Russiaâs border for 3 decades and they are specifically calling these forces âbattle groupsâ. Dr Johnson thinks Russia had really better watch out now that Albania is on board. 
Albania is well integrated into the EU hydra, yet itâs whole economy is based upon whores and heroin. They claim their biggest business is agriculture, yet they import everything they eat from outside, which seems to be a common problem among recent EU members. The process seems to be to bring countries that were self-sufficient into partnerships where they will then have to rely on others. This has happened with various former Soviet countries that were brought into the EU and Matt brings us another example in Venezuela. Norway has now broken itâs previous declaration to not allow American troops on itâs soil and Dr Johnson reminds us that Norway is a competitor with Russia for oil supplies. 
Matt points out that Russia has new updated nuclear warfare technology that the western media is calling âsatanâ and Dr Johnson thinks this move forward in technology was a reaction to the sanctions in Russia. It forced them to nationalise industries and do things for themselves and they will now be food independent by 2020. This is exactly what the NWOÂ doesnât want, a self sufficient nation able to defend itself without having to go cap in hand to America. 
The conversation then moves to America and Dr Johnson explains what polls mean when they say they are âover-samplingâ. This means that it is not a random sample but has been picked to over represent certain groups. The polls are just there to try and make it look less suspicious should they try to steal the election, because every form of registration online such as Facebook and Twitter shows Trump trouncing Clinton in supporters. 
The Democrats were given Hillaryâs questions from the media before being asked and the evidence is there that hired thugs have alsoÂ been used to intimidate Trump voters. If this was happening anywhere else in the world it would be universally condemned as an invalid election. It is also completely illegal to shut down a political rally, yet we have seen this happen more than once. 
If the election was cancelled however, it would just mean more of Obama in office, so there are not really any options of what else to do if these felonies were actually prosecuted. The level of corruption is so high that it is clear to everyone, in fact America could be in a pre-civil war state at the moment. When similar staged elections took place after the Jew instigated coup in Ukraine, Donesk and Luhansk rose up and separated themselves from the rest of the country. Could something like that ever happen in America?

But they were discrete about it. There was early marriage around 18-20 years old so most people were sexually inexperienced. Now people don't get married until POSSIBLY later and this gives ample time to work on the self-esteem of women to worry about their self-worth via their physical looks. Jews capitalize on this and the newest generation of Western women have been horribly manipulated into giving all the wrong signals in order to attract men. Tattoos? Slutty clothes? Have sex right away? White girls honestly think that is what white men like. Thanks jews!
The final result is that white men are not attracted to white women and so the social fabric and therefore power of white culture is destroyed. It is sad that white women have been duped into repulsing white men.
As a parallel story, my grandma knew my grandpa since childhood. She was a Roaring Twenties ""IT"" girl and partied it up My grandpa always cared about her and ""saved"" her from partying too much and married her. They had a wonderful, long, exciting marriage. I doubt my grandpa would have traded my grandma for a quiet and nun-like girl to save his life. He considered it a badge of honor to try and ""tame"" her Irish spirit. In the end their graves were right next to each other.
Guys, don't be too freaked out about by these amateur white girl sluts. You can still save them and make them settle down. A 40 year old burnt out slut, that's different.... Otherwise you will be (((deceived))) into a life of living alone with your computer [white genocide] or mating with an Asian. And well there are billions of chinks, they aren't exactly disappearing from the face of the earth....
Consider the ""slut"" act a desperate cry for help, white girls instinctively know they are being rejected/genocided and are acting out.

Today Dr. Duke and Dr. Slattery talked about Hillary’s clear acts of treason against the United States by providing massive shipments of weapons to Saudi Arabia at a time that she knew they were providing support to ISIS. Dr. Duke, if elected to the Senate, would be in a position to expose Hillary and push for her impeachment should she win (steal) the election. BLOOD ON THE TRAITOR’S HANDS! 
Dr. Slattery discussed post-election scenarios. He noted that if Trump wins in a close election, a small number of Republican electors could be bribed to vote for Hillary, throwing the election to her, or even vote for Pence, throwing the election to the House of Representatives to decide from amongst Trump, Hillary, and Pence. Should Hillary win and Trump supporters feel the election was illegitimate, impeachment would be more likely.

True Story? When I was growing up on the family farm a man came to the door and seemed to blow something into my parents face. My parents then started talking to him as if they had known them forever. Like they were great friends. He then started talking to me and said he was going to take me to school. This was during the summer. It was in July. I said ""This is summer vacation I already went to school."" He said yea, but I have another school for you to go to that will be fun. Your going to like this school. My parents said to go with the man. There seem to be something wrong with them as if they were in some sort of trance. I got in the car with the man as he seem to spray something into my face from a aerosol can. He drove a small foreign German made green car. I remember sort of falling asleep but was wide awake asleep and wide awake at the same time. The trance drug shocking blue made from the plant Burundanga can produce this state of mind. I remember waking up going around this road curve near the farm called horseshoe bend. This was in the 60's and the song ""Something tells me I'm into something good,"" by the Herman's Hermits was playing on the radio. I was looking out the window when it struck me when I looked over at the driver and realized I was riding with this strange man. It freaked me out and I grabbed for the steering wheel. He yelled stop and then it was like I had no control could only obey his order. I said where are you taking me? He said to school. I said this is summer I already went to school. I said what if I jump out of the car and run into the woods? He said he would chase me and kill me. I started crying. He then said, ""sorry I said that I didn't mean it."" He said why don't you just sit back and enjoy the ride. I said again where are you taking me. He said to school. Your going to like this school. There are lots of other kids there. I then seem to go to sleep. I awoke what seem to be a large hospital. It was in an underground facility at the aberdeen Military proving grounds base. There were nurses everywhere with around 50 hospital beds with children lying on them looking to be asleep with medical devices attached to their heads. This nurse told me to get on the bed. I did. Then this doctor approached me who I now know was doctor Joesef Megele the Nazi angel of death. He said his name was Doctor Green. He was young. I now know he is alive and living in Lancaster Pa among the amish. He takes youth drugs he developed in the Nazi child experimentation death camps in WWII. Like in a second later. Suddenly. I then seem to awake back on the farm. I was bagging up corn in the corn shed. I felt strange. Something wasn't right. It felt like summer was almost over. I didn't remember how I got to the corn shed. I asked my grandfather what day it is. He said, it's august 27th. Glad we found you in the woods since you went missing. Went missing? My grandfather said the police had searched the woods said I was missing for a few days this week. But they found me. In my mind I freaked out, august 27th? How could that be? I really had been missing for two months. I later learned that fake memories (FM's) were put into my grandfathers mind about the recent few days missing in the woods story. I remember it seemed like moments ago it was the beginning of July where I had my last memory. Then the memories started to flood as the retrograde amnesia was lifting from the trance drug I was administered. Memories of hundreds of children from around the world in cages stacked on top of one another. I was in a cage high up me and a girl named Mary and another kid named Billy and some other kid I can't remember his name all of us together in this cage. Billy was told to kill the other little kid in the cage. If he did strangled him they would let him go. It was horrible. Sadly he did screaming and crying the whole time.

It has long been a controversy for the United States often getting involved in affairs that shouldn't necessarily involve them. Many other countries believe that the United State is nothing more warmongers who lust for more power and authority over the many weaker countries throughout the world, hence the history of unwarranted wars that have taken place throughout. 
Some of these range from the Vietnam War, which was shown to have been a basis that never existed in the Gulf of Tonkin event. Another infamous event includes the idea to invade Iraq, which included the destruction of many innocent people, but did not assist in any way for any other country. It created more hatred however. Troops From US May Open Up Shop In Norway 
Despite all this, it is now being believed that US troops may be joining their NATO ally in Norway by stationing troops in the country of Norway. It is expected to involve over 300 marines going to Norway. This is troubling as it is the first time foreign troops have come to the country, since the devastating events of World War ll. Could this possibly be a preparation for World War lll, if the United States is coming to a country that is near Russia? 
It could affect Norway as the Defense Minister has expressed serious concern regarding the Russian military, which has continued to flex its muscles through the takeover of many smaller countries with mere ease. Norway has come under some fire about the decision to involve the United States as some believe this is not a good signal to show to someone that opposes them as it looks like they are welcoming the idea of a war . 
Some also believe that Norway should try to defend itself by reinforcing its own army rather than involving the United States troops to give them a helping hand. Some also believe that it makes them look rather weak if they are instantly calling upon their strongest ally in the United States to help them as soon as they start to have a fear of a certain situation. 
What remains unknown is what may develop upon stationing these troops. Is World War lll on the cusp of existence with the strategic and sudden move by Norway? Hopefully not, because this could easily be as devastating as all of the other wars combined, given the advancement of fighting techniques.

Among the biggest changes? The letter “s.” The previous site was known as “Mormons and Gays” — as if those two groups were separate or even opponents. The one that launched Tuesday is “Mormon and Gay,” signaling the notion that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints can be — and are — both.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security once again ramped up its sabre-rattling routine, threatening that residents in states that have not complied with REAL ID will not be able to use their driver’s licenses to board aircraft beginning in 2018. States should ignore the DHS bluster, stand their ground and continue their refusal to implement this unconstitutional national ID program. 

REAL ID essentially coopts the states into creating a national ID system. The federal government has no constitutional authority to mandate a national ID. 

The federal government repeats this song and dance every couple of years, and has done so since Pres. George W. Bush signed REAL ID into law in 2005. Instead of following through on threats the feds simply keep extending their deadlines. 

Under the law, all 50 states were supposed comply with the federal law by 2009. But, states rebelled against REAL ID for several reasons, including privacy concerns and the fact that Congress didn’t provide any funding for the mandates it expects states to implement.

Serbia’s president has accused the European Union of setting “humiliating” conditions for the Balkan country’s membership. 

Tomislav Nikolic told visiting Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar that Serbia would move to adopt the EU’s fundamental principles and values even though the 28-nation bloc is in crisis. 

Nikolic did not say which EU conditions he finds humiliating, but may have been referring to demands from some members for Serbia to recognize the breakaway former province of Kosovo as an independent country. 

Serbia, a traditional ally of Russia, wants to join the EU, but has been under intense pressure from the Kremlin to reconsider.

Korea a ‘lost cause,’ US intel chief says Convincing North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons is a “lost cause,” America’s top intelligence official said, causing concern in the State Department and ally South Korea over an issue of long-standing US policy. The United States has always maintained it cannot accept North Korea as a nuclear state and, under President Barack Obama, has made any talks with the North conditional on Pyongyang first making some tangible commitment towards denuclearisation. But in remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations think-tank, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper on Tuesday suggested such a policy was based on wishful thinking. “The notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause. They are not going to do that. That is their ticket to survival,” Clapper said. “They are under siege, and they are very paranoid. So the notion of giving up their nuclear capability, whatever it is, is a nonstarter with them,” he added.",english,2016-10-26T22:29:24.322+03:00,endtime.com,US,,"Denuclearizing N.

In recent days, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has acted to achieve the support of the 21 countries to vote against the expected condemnations, but sources in Jerusalem say that the results are already clear, and the committee will almost certainly pass the draft resolution against Israel. 

According to those same sources, the reason for this is that “troublesome” composition of UNESCO’s World Heritage Committee. Countries like Germany, Colombia and Japan, who were part of the committee last year, left and have been replaced by notoriously anti-Israeli countries like Kuwait, Lebanon and Indonesia. 

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the scheduled vote and said, “This is the continuation of the theatre of the absurd.

The resolution, the Speaker wrote, “is an assault on history and is deeply offensive to both Christianity and Judaism. The denial of the historicity of the two Jerusalem Temples and the Temple Mount as recounted in both the Old and New Testaments is a terrible indictment of the international community when repeatedly adopted by an important UN body. 
“The outrageous repudiation of the millennia-old bond between Judaism and its holiest shrines in Jerusalem is a blatant attempt to rewrite history,” he added. “The annals of both our religions cannot be erased by raised hands and counted votes.” 
Edelstein said the time has come for the international community to pass a resolution reaffirming Jerusalem as the holy city for the three major monotheistic religions, “a city where the two Temples stood and from which the Word of G-d was first promulgated to humanity by our prophets.”

С лёгкой руки итальянского режиссёра Тинто Брасса римский император Калигула стал символом самого порочного разврата и воплощением аморального поведения. Но даже у него отношения с миром братьев наших меньших, то есть животных, носили чисто платонический характер: Калигула назначил своего любимого коня сенатором, но отнюдь не любимой женой. Так что, согласно недавним сообщениям СМИ, актёр Алексей Панин, якобы занявшийся зоофилией, переплюнул самого одиозного, не считая Нерона, римского императора. 
Сам Панин, разумеется, всё категорически отрицает. По его словам, на скандальном видео с собакой заснят не он, а другой мужчина, очень похожий на Панина. (Помните, человек, похожий на прокурора, с женщинами, похожими на проституток?). В раскручивании этой омерзительной истории Панин обвиняет бывшую жену, которой почему-то не нравится то, что актёр не платит алименты. Коварная женщина смонтировала видеозапись и каким-то образом воздействовала на создателей программы «Говорим и показываем», рискнувших пустить её в эфир. В общем, кругом враги, но Панин не намерен сдаваться и пойдёт в суд, чтобы доказать, что он и близко не подходил к собаке ни с какой стороны. 
Тех, кто ещё не утомился следить за извилистым творческим путём Алексея Панина, разгоревшийся скандал не слишком удивляет: ведь основой своего имиджа этот актёр сознательно сделал крайний эпатаж на грани, а то и за гранью фола. То он голым по гостинице “Версаль” бегает, то публично, пардон, рукоблудием занимается, то в лифте гадит – чего, как известно, ни одна воспитанная собака себе не позволит. Что до мелких потасовок и матерных перепалок, то им уже самые преданные поклонники счёт потеряли. 
В показушном мире шоу-бизнеса, где слава является смыслом жизни, каждый пытается выделиться, чем может: кто-то большим талантом, кто-то большим бюстом, а кто-то непомерным непотребством. Здесь всё ясно, и обсуждать, в общем-то, нечего. Вопрос в другом: есть ли грань, за которую СМИ не смогут зайти в погоне за сенсацией? Неважно, кто заснят на зоофильском видео: есть вещи, которые просто нельзя демонстрировать на экране телевизора. И здесь, как ни странно, хочется поддержать Панина в его планируемом иске к авторам передачи: если цензуры нравов нет, это не значит, что напоказ всё дозволено. Так что, ещё неизвестно, кто переплюнул Калигулу: актёр или режиссёр программы.",russian,2016-10-26T21:41:39.415+03:00,fognews.ru,RU,,Переплюнуть Калигулу…,0,http://fognews.ru/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/panin-357x200.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, is sure that the bloodshed in South-East Ukraine could be avoided if the country’s authorities apologized to the population of the DPR and LPR like Verkhovna Rada deputy Nadezhda Savchenko proposed. 
The Russian diplomat said this in commenting on the statement of the Verhkovna Rada’s vice speaker, Irina Gerashchenko, made at a meeting of the UN Security council in which the Kiev representative once again accused Russia of aggression against Ukraine. In addition, the Ukrainian politician called Savchenko “the most famous prisoner of the Kremlin freed in exchange for military personnel from the Russian Army.” 
“In her speech, Ukraine’s representative mentioned Nadezhda Savchenko. After being pardoned, she returned to her homeland where she stated that Kiev should apologize to the residents of Donetsk and Lugansk. It is a pity that Ukrainian authorities don’t have enough humanity or political courage to do so,” Churkin said. 
According to Churkin, the inter-Ukrainian crisis would have been resolved long ago if Kiev didn’t attempt time and time again to change the Minsk Agreements. He stressed: “There would have been no conflict in Donbass if Kiev had not opted for armed suppression of the dissent that arose after a coup backed by foreign forces was carried out in the country.”  

Russia’s UN representative added that for two years already “Ukrainian security forces have shelled residential areas of Donetsk and Lugansk, as a result of which civilians, including women and children, have been killed.” He referred to the UN High Commissioner for Human Right’s report on abductions and torture to which Ukrainian forces have subjected women.

After slamming into the veteran's car, the men told an off-duty police officer, ""I did it on purpose. It was in the name of Allah."" 
Scott Alcala was going to play a round of golf with his father when the attack occurred. 
Alcala had to act quickly and swerve into oncoming traffic in an attempt to avoid a Chevy Suburban that was headed straight for him. 
""I saw the suburban coming right at me about to T-bone right into the driver door and I thought that was it,"" he said. ""A second later I turned my head and just smashed into the barrier."" 
Both men survived and no one else was involved. However, Acala says an off-duty police officer went to check on the other man. 
""The off-duty police officer went to talk to the other driver in his vehicle and he said, 'Are you alright? That was way too fast,' and (the driver) said 'I did it on purpose,"" Acala recalled. ""It was in the name of Allah.'"" 
Fox 26 reports : 
The police report says driver Ameer Abbaf Fakhraldin told police the collision was caused by Donald Trump's improper treatment of minorities, and by Allah and other people's lack of faith in him. Fakhraldin estimated his speed was 100 miles per hour. He also told police he caused the crash by using psychic / telekinetic powers to control the steering. The officer at the scene said the driver showed apathy and neglected interest. 
Police haven't specified if this was an act of terrorism but Alcala thinks it was. 
""There was no remorse,"" Acala said. ""He just went back to his car nonchalant, pulled out a water bottle and just posted up."" 
""He was just trying to target as many people as he could,"" he added. ""He was just trying to cause a pile up. It wasn't me personally. It was as if someone were to throw a bomb in the middle of downtown, it's no different, it's the same thinking."" 
Mr. Acala then added that as a veteran, having fought over seas, this makes him feel like he is encountering a war zone in his homeland. 
""Coming back from Afghanistan, thinking I'm on home soil I'm safe now… just shouldn't have to worry about something like that you know,"" he said.

According to Democrats, the only thing in life which isn’t rigged is this election. 
As long as Hillary Clinton is said by the pollsters to be in the lead and likely to win, the “system” is just fine – but only the election system. 
It can’t be rigged if the democrats win. A democrat being in power is the natural order of things. I think it may actually be a part of Darwin’s evolutionary theory. First the protozoa, then the fish, then the ape, then the Neanderthal Republican, and finally, the enlightened progressive Democrat. That’s how it goes – right? 
It is amusing that the same people and party, who claim that everything in America is somehow rigged, think it ridiculous when the Republican nominee claims that of this election – and that Republican voters are the ones this time being “disenfranchised.” 
In August of this year, the Washington Post claimed that Exxon Mobil is “rigging the system” against green energy. Of course they are. After all, they are the poster-corporation of evil “big oil.” “As recently as last year, it continued to fund organizations that play down the risks of carbon pollution,” writes the Post. 
So “rigged” is the system that the AGs of the communist states of New York and Massachusetts, “are investigating whether ExxonMobil violated state laws by knowingly misleading their residents and shareholders about climate change.” 
Big Oil – Climate Change – Rigged – Check. 
In 2015, Director of the University of Cambridge Master of Finance program, Simon Taylor wrote that, “Bank executive pay appears rigged against women.” He found that female bank execs’ “pay packages typically have a much lower level of incentive compensation,” netting women much less than male counterparts. 
That same year, the NewStatesman.com wrote that, “Women can’t have it all – because the game is rigged.” The author is upset that women have to “choose” between having a high-powered career and spending time raising a family. Yeah – I know. If the system wasn’t so “rigged,” women could have it all – a model family and equal pay – unless, of course, if they work for the Clinton Foundation. 
Women – Equal Pay – Rigged – Check 
Naturally, the system is “rigged” against the poor and the middle class. The working class warrior, Elizabeth Warren , who is worth almost $15 million, said in an interview with CNN : “Let's just be real clear - the game is rigged and it's rigged in favor of those who have money and who have power,” like Elizabeth Warren. 
Middle Class – Poor – Workers of the World Unite - Rigged – Check 
There are many more examples of the democrats and liberals in general (redundant) whining of this ethereal system being rigged against every constituent group under their umbrella , that I would be remiss to not mention the seminal complaint of all the left. The system has been and will always be rigged against blacks – particularly the justice system. 
Everywhere in America, according to the left, are examples of a rigged justice system, where blacks, minding their own business, are rounded up, arrested, and summarily shot. So rigged is the system , that “George Washington University law professor Paul Butler, who is a former federal prosecutor, has suggested the remedy ought to be widespread jury nullification. ‘It is, in fact, the moral responsibility of black jurors to emancipate some guilty black outlaws.’” 
Blacks – Social Justice – Rigged – Check 
With all this “rigging” going on, maybe the only fair thing to do is allow Hillary and her minions to do whatever they must to win, thus righting some of the wrongs of the rigged system. It should be our moral responsibility to emancipate some guilty democrat outlaws.

Two weeks before the most outrageous presidential election in history, the stakes for the economic future of our country are high. There is no question that the U.S. economy is in terrible shape and that the policy decisions made in the last ten years have negatively affected everyone who trades, invests, and use the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Are voters going to choose free market economic recovery with Trump or global collectivism with Clinton? 
The government statistics claim that there are officially 8 million unemployed but the actual unemployment numbers are closer to 16 million people. The reported labor force of almost 156 million in 2000 has shrunk to 152 million today. The reported number of Americans “not in the labor force” is an astonishing 94 million. These are discouraged workers who are no longer counted as unemployed. This explains why this administration’s unemployment numbers are so rosy and low. For up to date numbers, visit the national debt clock here. http://www.usdebtclock.org/ 
Our national debt is astronomical, approaching $20 trillion while GDP is below $19 trillion. We already owe more than we make in a year in final goods and services. Gross debt to GDP ratio is 106.38 percent. The U.S. total debt is $67 trillion. However, if we add all the unfunded liabilities such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and Obamacare , the figure jumps much higher. 
The federal budget deficit (the difference between taxation and spending) is almost $6 trillion for this year. The more indebted we are to the rest of the world and to each other, the less money will be available for future generations to improve their standard of living and to defend themselves. 
There are approximately 119 million U.S. taxpayers and approximately 124 million full-time workers. The biggest part of the revenue from taxation is spent on entitlements. Somehow, Social Security, a fund established with automatic paycheck contributions, has been lumped in with entitlements as if the Social Security fund did not belong to the tax payers but to the government. 
Our Congress loves to spend money on entitlements because the recipients vote them back into office. Revenue to GDP ratio is a positive 35.6 percent but spending to GDP ratio is a red 36.04 percent. 
During the third presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said that she would make sure public college education will be free, that parents will not receive a bill for their children’s college degree, and she will do it by not adding one penny to the national debt. 
After fact checking the statement, it turns out to be not true. One source claims that $500 billion will be added to the national debt in the next 10 years while the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that “$200 billion will be spent on infrastructure, financial aid for college students, and early childhood education.” 
The current student loan debt is $1.4 trillion and growing. There are 50,182,018 public school students who will eventually take advantage of this “free” college offer Hillary Clinton has made. Who is going to pay? Taxpayers, of course, will be saddled with the cost. 
Additionally, how is she going to create jobs to employ college graduates if her plan includes raising taxes? Employers create jobs when their taxes are decreased. NAFTA, which was President Bill Clinton’s achievement, has exported many manufacturing jobs overseas. Hillary Clinton supports the highly secretive Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would finish off the manufacturing sector in this country, leaving the United States as a service economy. 
We now have 12,500,256 manufacturing jobs left in this country. In 2000 we had 19,462,745 manufacturing jobs. There are about 120 million private sector jobs but large companies are pushing for more H-1B visas to import cheap technical labor from India and other foreign nations, leaving seasoned employees out of a job and having to train their replacements. More college graduates living in their parents’ basement will have to work as baristas in coffee shops. 
Trump is in favor of school choice and wants to end Common Core. He favors the reintroduction of Vocational and Technical education, as well as making two and four-year college education affordable. 
Donald Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA and to withdraw from TPP. He wants to end foreign trade abuses and currency manipulation by China. He wants to repatriate our own companies by reducing corporate taxation significantly and by establishing tariffs to prevent companies from leaving in the first place. He wants to offer middle class tax relief that would help create 25 million jobs. He wants to simplify the tax code. 
Trump wants to create jobs by lifting regulatory restrictions on fossil fuel exploration and all mining. He wants to “lift road blocks that prevent the Keystone pipeline from moving forward.” 
Trump wants to cancel payments to the United Nations Climate Fund and use the money to fix our water and environmental infrastructure. 
Hillary Clinton wants to expand illegal immigration and open borders while Trump wants to cancel federal funding of sanctuary cities that harbor criminal illegal aliens. He will “suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur.” 
He will establish punishments for visa overstays, for repeat criminal offenders, and multiple illegal border crossings. Adamant that he will build the wall with Mexico, Trump promises to remove criminal aliens from the U.S. and to cancel visas to countries that won’t take them back. 
Restoring the rule of law, dismantling criminal gangs, establishing a task force on violent crime to help police, cleaning up corruption, and admitting immigrants who have been thoroughly vetted, who want to be a contributing part of our country, should go a long way to begin the process of healing our nation. 
Hillary wants to continue President Obama’s policies, including the admittance of many more “refugees” from countries that are inimical to us. 
While Hillary wants to develop Obamacare into a one payer system, Trump wants to “repeal and replace” the very costly and unaffordable Affordable Care Act which has made healthcare premiums unaffordable for so many Americans who were forced to drop their insurance and just pay the tax penalty. 
Trump favors health savings accounts, letting states manage Medicaid funds, and allowing Americans to buy insurance across state lines. Cutting the red tape at the FDA is also on his radar. He promises to fix VA hospitals and to allow veterans to be treated by their chosen doctor in any private or public hospital. 
Will Trump have the opportunity to replace Justice Scalia or will Hillary alter the composition of the Supreme Court, turning it into a bastion of progressivism for generations to come? 
Trump promises to expand and strengthen our military, to guard our First and Second Amendments, and to protect our Constitution. 
It is time that American hard-earned dollars take care of Americans first instead of providing for the rest of the world to the detriment of poor Americans, redistributing our wealth through schemes that the globalists behind Hillary Clinton have devised. Americans want to have secure borders, sovereignty, one language, self-determination, and economic prosperity through free markets not through collectivism. shares",english,2016-10-26T22:36:44.302+03:00,freedomoutpost.com,US,40480,Free Market Economic Recovery with Trump or Global Collectivism with Hillary,0,http://freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/635847026848929168897612321-maxresdefault.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Although members of Congress are now absolutely outraged the Pentagon is trying to recoup bonuses given out to thousands of troops, it turns out, Congress actually knew about this problem for at least two years. 
Andreas Mueller, chief of federal policy for the California National Guard, wrote an email to the California congressional delegation, stating the Guard told members of Congress about the bonus reclamation issue two years ago, The Los Angeles Times reports. 
In fact, Mueller noted that the Guard had even offered a solution, but Congress took zero action. 
In effect, the scandal stems back to about a decade when the National Guard was called upon to supply more troops. Guard officials were only supposed to give out bonuses to high-value positions like intelligence or civil affairs, to incentivize more soldiers to head to Iraq and Afghanistan during a marked troop shortage. But that rule was ignored and thousands of soldiers received bonuses they weren’t actually supposed to, unbeknownst to them. 
Now, the Pentagon wants those bonuses back and with interest. 
Since the story first broke Saturday, members of Congress have declared how abhorrent it is for veterans to be targeted with tax liens and wage garnishment for refusing to pay back these bonuses. GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Marine Corps reservist, wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense Ash Carter on Sunday, asking for him to get involved as to find a solution to this “boneheaded” decision . 
On the other side of the aisle, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi sent House Speaker Paul Ryan a letter Monday arguing that as soon as Congress gets back in session, members should immediately pass legislation to halt the Pentagon’s collection efforts. 
Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer also wrote a letter to Carter, insisting that he had the power to simply forgive the debts without any action from Congress. 
“Thousands of our service members are paying the price for mistakes made by California National Guard managers, some of whom are now serving jail time or paying restitution for their crimes,” Feinstein and Boxer said . “It is outrageous to hold these service members and their families responsible for the illegal behavior of others.” 
But in the meantime, the California Guard certainly does not have the legal power to forgive debts, however much it might want to do so.

There is a sizeable faction in this country that is disgusted with the choices we have going into the 2016 General Election. While the choices are far from the quality a great nation like the United States deserves, they are what they are. No amount of complaining, abdication of responsibility, or indignation will change this reality. 
But, like it or not, the outcome of this election will affect each and every one of us, and in ways that can never be rectified in our lifetimes, if at all. It is for that reason that this election is a referendum on the issues, not on the candidates. It is also for this reason that it needs to be reiterated – in no uncertain terms – that General Elections are not for electing your favorite candidate. They are for protecting the country from the worst candidate. 
Right now, we have two candidates – arguably not the best the country can offer, who possess two extremely different visions for the country. It is about these differences – exclusively – that we must base our choices come Election Day. Put bluntly, this election isn’t about personalities, capabilities, soundbites or even criminality; it is about issues, and on these issues, we do have choices to make. 
Yes, the names on the ballot give us pause. I will cede that point but offer this rebuttal for your consideration. 
On the one hand, we have a politically untested, braggadocios businessman in Donald Trump who routinely makes statements before he thinks about the consequences of his words. But while many may have their principles insulted by the prospect of casting a vote for such an overt braggart, there is no question that he loves and appreciates the country that has allowed him to be so successful. 
On the other hand, we have Hillary Clinton , a woman who has, but for a very short stint at a private law firm, always lived taking a taxpayer-funded government check. For getting on 30 years this woman has fed off the taxpayer feed trough, advancing her ideological agenda – one tilted to the whims of the Fabian Progressive that she is, admittedly, and establishing and engaging in bureaucratic corruption so extensive that she has been able to parlay her “public service” into an amassed wealth of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
So, in personality and professionally, we have a stark and glaring choice in the people that are on the ballot. One, Trump, has a love of country but no political prowess, the other, Clinton, has decades of inside-the-beltway experience but a deeply seeded desire to “fundamentally transform” the nation from a Constitutional Republic to a Socialist Democracy administered by a Progressive oligarchy. 
Larger than the personalities in this election, however, are two very important and critical issues; issues that these two candidates – as flawed as they are – have decidedly different ideas about. 
We are standing at a moment where we control whether or not the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) remains a binding law or whether it gets repealed. Make no mistake, Hillary Clinton, if elected, will cement this incredibly unconstitutional law into the very fabric of our country for all-time. The only way Obamacare will be abandoned under a Clinton Administration is in deference to the establishment of a full-blown single-payer health insurance system administered by the Federal Government, i.e. nationalized healthcare. 
Donald Trump, on the other hand, has made a cornerstone of his campaign the repeal of Obamacare. He has pledged to destroy the artificial barriers in the marketplace – barriers erected by insurance company-friendly politicians – that keep the free market from allowing competition that would dramatically lower premium costs for everyone. This, as a result – through competition in the free market – would make health insurance affordable for all. 
So, the choice is abundantly clear – unless you are a Socialist or a Marxist – on who has already earned your vote on the issue of Obamacare. Unless you want your health insurance premiums to rise to unaffordability and the quality of your healthcare to take a downturn to that of a Third World country, you need to cast a vote for Donald Trump so that Hillary Clinton doesn’t make Obamacare permanent. 
Then there is the matter of the United States Supreme Court. The direction of the nation, with regard to constitutionalism, hangs in the balance this election. With the next President of the United States most likely getting to nominate three, and possibly four, United States Supreme Court justices, we are at a crossroads as to whether we jettison the Constitution completely or return to being a “nation of laws and not of men,” of which John Adams spoke. 
The US Supreme Court is seated to protect and defend the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights, exclusively. The justices are tasked with ruling on the constitutionality of law, not on the people effected by that law. As   Bill of Rights were crafted to serve all of the people – regardless of race, creed, gender or economic class – serving the Constitution is, by that very act, serving the people. 
Hillary Clinton, in the last debate, spoke of appointing Supreme Court justices who would be empathetic to the people and their causes. She talked of her selections being mindful of the people in the decisions they would be faced with making. She said she envisions a Supreme Court that “stands up on behalf of women’s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizen’s United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country” and that her nominees would be “in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans.” 
But none of that – none of it – is what the US Supreme Court is supposed to engage in, as duly noted above. Women, the LGBT community, and even the political process are best served when the Constitution is best served and adequately protected. What Hillary Clinton proposed, in her answer, was to establish an activist special-interest Supreme Court bench that serves entities rather than the Constitution, a document that serves everyone equitably and equally when administered as the Framers intended. 
In incredible and stark contrast, Donald Trump has pledged to nominate justices to the Supreme Court who would interpret the Constitution “the way the Founders wanted it interpreted.” In that short, simple response Trump said what each and every American should want to hear in an answer to that query. He will appoint justices that will serve and protect the Constitution, returning the Supreme Court to the rule of law. 
So, again, unless you are a “social justice” activist with a Fabian Progressive bent, the choice is clear on who should get your vote regarding the issue of the US Supreme Court. Trump wants justices who rule on constitutionality, while Clinton wants justices who rule on a special-interest, social justice agenda. 
In the worst case scenario; should Hillary Clinton win on November 8th, we can be guaranteed of two things. First, Obamacare and its never-ending rate hikes – not to mention the Progressive march to a single-payer health insurance system run exclusively by the Federal Government – will be here forever. Second, the US Supreme Court – and the whole of the federal courts beneath it – will be lost to at least one generation (maybe two) of Progressive-Liberalism; codifying countless new “social justice” laws and mandates onto the American people. 
These are the issues that consume this election. To wit, this election is an ipso facto referendum on Obamacare and the direction of the US Supreme Court, nothing else; no personalities, no crimes, no sex scandals, nothing else. 
This is why there can be no abdication by the American people of their responsibilities to vote. Yes, the candidates may not be the best our nation has to offer, but the issues are more serious than the personality, ethics and knowledge deficits possessed by either. Just because you may hate the choices doesn’t mean the issues become benign. 
While Trump, if he should win, may end up having to surround himself with people more knowledgeable than he on most every matter, that is infinitely better than giving the Oval Office to Hillary Clinton, who has been slated as the “clean-up hitter” in the Progressive fundamental transformation of America. 
It is for that reason that sitting this election out – refusing to vote because of the quality, demeanor, ethics or perceived personality deficits of the candidates – is an exercise of abdication of responsibility; to the country, future generations and the US Constitution. In the end, it is the most selfish thing an American can do at this point in American history. shares",english,2016-10-26T23:00:51.618+03:00,freedomoutpost.com,US,40480,"Like It Or Not, This Election Is A Referendum",0,http://freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/vote.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

You may remember when Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore was removed from the bench in 2003 for disobeying an unlawful mandate to remove a Ten Commandments monument in the Alabama Supreme Court building. Ten years later, however, the people of Alabama overwhelmingly voted their heroic defender of liberty back to his position in 2013. This example proves that many American citizens are looking for elected officials who uphold   hold moral conviction! 
Sadly, the Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice has again been unlawfully removed from the bench at the hands of liberal activists on Alabama’s Court of the Judiciary (COJ), due to an administrative order issued by Moore that stated, “Until further decision by the Alabama Supreme Court, the existing orders of the Alabama Supreme Court that Alabama probate judges have a ministerial duty not to issue any marriage license contrary to the Alabama Sanctity of Marriage Amendment or the Alabama Marriage Protection Act remain in full force and effect."" 
Chief Justice Moore remarked, “I have been targeted for my belief in marriage, a belief shared by the majority of Americans. No one can point to any illegal, unlawful or unethical aspect of my four-page Administrative Order. That order was a status report on the case. A justice should not be removed from office because of a political agenda.” 
You see God created marriage - not man, not governments. 
Consider the following analogy. You lease a home in a residential neighborhood for your personal residence. You sign a contract –your vow—and move in to enjoy that new home. Later, you decide you want to open a retail business in that home against the owner’s wishes and against your contract. No matter what kind of attorney arsenal you have, you cannot change the zoning of that residence into a business; it is not permissible in the contract, and you don’t own the home. 
In the same way, marriage belongs to God, and He has given us the benefit of it. For this reason, when you make marriage vows, you are asked to repeat them twice. The first time is a vow to God, who creates the marriage, and the second time is your vow to the other person. 
Our founders have long since passed into the annals of history. Their monuments are lifeless stone and can no longer rectify or redeem the champions of their spiritual cause of liberty. That is our job as Americans. To defend and pray for Chief Justice Roy Moore is our duty. Why? Because as Americans, we believe in the “Laws of Nature and Nature’s God” that were set in motion by our Creator to protect the Rights He has given us.

“He'd [Vladimir Putin] rather have a puppet as president of the United States.” 
“No puppet, no puppet… You're the puppet,” was Mr. Trump's honest reply. 
Excuse me, but which scandal-embroiled candidate made a dirty U.S. uranium deal with Russia? Which same one blatantly broke American law and fostered potential espionage? As with everything two-faced Hillary says, the truth opposes her own words and deeds. Via Charity-gate , Mrs. Clinton did the former; with Server-gate, she did the latter. Thus, at the debate, she falsely accused Trump of her own crimes. This behavior is classical psychological projection: her own deep-seeded guilt blamed on her innocent political opponent. 
Beyond a worthless apology, Hillary's blame game never includes herself. Mr. Trump's call to Russia to release her illegally destroyed emails (if they have them) isn't espionage. He has nothing to do with what was left unprotected or has likely been stolen. First, wasn't it Hillary who intentionally had unauthorized, private servers set up in the first place as Secretary of State? Second, wasn't it Mrs. Clinton's responsibility to follow the law forbidding such extraneous storage of classified information? Third, since she knowingly ignored the rules, doesn't she own the consequences of hackers and potentially “interfering” foreign governments in next month's election? 
Hillary has aided Russia, the foreign government she now publicly demonizes. In reality, if anyone is a hypothetical puppet of Putin's, it's Hillary Clinton , not Donald Trump. Specifically, her State Department approved the Uranium One deal, which insanely ceded Russian control of 20% of American produced uranium for a fat donation to her pay for play sham of a charity, the Clinton Foundation . (That's the highly prized “ yellow cake ” used in nuclear weapons.) What's to stop the Kremlin from sharing the extra supply with their Middle East allies, the nuclearly ambitious Iranian Imams ? You know, the same bearded fellows who finessed a toothless, Obama-approved nuclear deal that virtually guarantees them the bomb within the next decade? The answer to all of the above is nothing at all. 
Moreover, if the Soviets do have her destroyed emails, Mr. Putin has a treasure trove of top secret material with which to blackmail the normally paranoid and self-obsessed Hillary . Therefore, Mrs. Clinton would waste critical years in office (vital to the continued solvency of America) looking only to save her own skin. Indeed, the next president must contend with the escalating, unsustainable 19.7T debt . (That sounds like a wheelhouse challenge to a businessman and job creator like Donald Trump .) 
Yet, Hillary's not up to that, or anything constructive. Crooked Hillary will be embroiled in ever worsening scandals, and future Nixon style cover-ups. Just like her impeached hubby Bill, she'll remain in an endless cycle of political damage control. Recall her already well-established track record of incompetence and lawlessness. While the country seizes in a hellish Clinton Administration death spiral, how would this divisive rabble-rouser lead—except disastrously—over a social and economic cliff? 
It doesn't take a dummy to know who's better for America's future . If ventriloquists were Wall Street bankers, speechifying “Hillary six figures” would be their open borders , amnesty-promising marionette. Brassy Donald Trump should not be confused with any of that. Unlike the shifty one percenters who finance Mrs. Clinton's corrupt candidacy, Donald Trump's a captain of industry who can't be bought. He already has all of the fame, wealth and power anyone could want. America needs his tell-it-like-it-is 'can-do' optimism—not an elitist figurehead for foreign and domestic special interest groups, and corporate masters. shares",english,2016-10-26T23:35:43.973+03:00,freedomoutpost.com,US,40480,Puppet Hillary's Blame Game,0,http://freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hillary-scandals-700X395-326x245.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

A juror in the trial of seven militia members charged with seizing a U.S. wildlife refuge in Oregon at gunpoint earlier this year was dismissed for bias, a federal judge said on Wednesday. 
Prosecutors and defense attorneys in the case agreed to the dismissal of the juror, who formerly worked for the federal Bureau of Land Management, after U.S. District Judge Anna Brown said the juror would be questioned more closely about comments he may have made about his bias. 
“It’s a new jury, a new day, a new start,” Brown said. 
Brown said deliberations by the jury would start over. An alternate will step in for the dismissed juror. 
The attorney for Ammon Bundy, the leader of those charged, asked the court in a motion on Wednesday morning to dismiss the juror in question and order the jury to begin deliberations again or declare a mistrial. 
The jury’s integrity came under scrutiny on Tuesday when it sent the judge a letter saying one juror admitted being “very biased” as deliberations began last week. 
“Can a juror, a former employee of the Bureau of Land Management, who opens their remarks in deliberations by stating ‘I am very biased …’ be considered an impartial judge in this case?’ the letter stated, according to the motion by Bundy’s lawyer, Marcus Mumford. 
While it was unclear whether the supposed bias of the juror, identified as Juror No. 11, was for or against the government, Mumford had said further questioning of the person was needed. 
Brown interviewed the juror in private on Tuesday and said she found “no basis” for determining he was biased. Prosecutors had previously opposed additional interrogation of the jury.",english,2016-10-26T22:00:19.000+03:00,fromthetrenchesworldreport.com,US,,Juror in Oregon militia trial dismissed for bias: judge,0,http://www.fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/images/default-user-image.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs

The most important ecological crisis of the world has ever seen has been underway since March 11th, 2011, yet there is nary a mention of it in the corporate media, and no political body in the world is championing its resolution. Widespread Denial and Willful Ignorance 
The effects on nature are already being seen, yet even among the environmentalist factions of media, there is strong denial of the damage already done and of what is to come as the crisis approaches its sixth year. Some 300 tons of radioactive water are dumped into the Pacific Ocean each day , and signs are showing that this catastrophe is gravely affecting sea-life and wildlife in and around the Pacific . 
The FDA maintains that there is no evidence of contamination by Fukushima borne radionuclides in the American food supply, yet this opinion is contested by some independent researchers. A report by the Fairewinds Energy Education says that cancer is on the rise in areas around the failed power plant, and that millions will die in coming years as a result. “[T]he second report received from Japan proves that the incidence of thyroid cancer is approximately 230 times higher than normal in Fukushima Prefecture… So what’s the bottom line? The cancers already occurring in Japan are just the tip of the iceberg. I’m sorry to say that the worst is yet to come.” [ Source ] 
As election year in the U.S. approaches its dramatic climax, it has been striking to observe that neither of the major two-party candidates, or third-party candidates for that matter, have mentioned this crisis at all during the entire election run up. It is a non-issue in American politics, and if you’re listening, the silence is deafening. The 40-Year-Plan 
Thus far, all plans to stop radioactive contamination of the Pacific Ocean and the Japanese Islands have failed, the most impressive of which is the construction of a $320 million underground wall of frozen dirt to block the seepage of groundwater into surrounding areas. 1oo feet deep and over a mile long, the ‘ land-side impermeable wall ‘ is already failing as rainfall from recent typhoons has caused partial melting of sections of the ‘ice wall.’ Workers examine pipes for the wall of frozen soil at the embattled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant. Image Credit: http://www.asahi.com/ 
A previous and ongoing cleanup effort requires the on site storage of contaminated water near the Fukushima Daiichi is merely a band-aid as radioactive water continues to accumulate by the day , with no long term plan for proper disposal. 
“…the filtered water is still full of tritium , a radioactive version of hydrogen. (When two neutrons are added to the element, it becomes unstable, prone to emitting electrons.) Tritium bonds with oxygen just like normal hydrogen does, to produce radioactive “tritiated water.” It’s impractical—or at least extremely difficult and expensive—to separate tritiated water from normal water.” [ Source ] Storage tanks at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. 
The reality here is that this crisis is untouchable in its scope and unparalleled in its lethality, and TEPCO’s 40-year-plan to decommission the plant will be a failure. Final Thoughts 
No one of significant import is talking about this crisis or working to elevate it as a national and international priority. The American political scene is focused instead on the selection of the next president being chosen between two candidates who clearly have zero interest in addressing this dire issue. 
Is this because nothing can be done about it? Is this because the energy industry is controlling the conversation and covering up the truth ? Or is this because the agenda for the U.S. at present is geared to destabilization and a push for expansion of the Orwellian Permanent War , and ecological disasters are supportive of the global depopulation scheme in play? 
In any case, the Fukushima meltdown is a slow-burning apocalyptic event that desperately needs our attention.

In the midst of deepening tension between US allies NATO and Russia, NATO is planning the largest military buildup along the Russian border since the cold war. 
NATO called on allied governments this week to contribute whatever troops and equipment they can to the effort. According to Reuters, thousands of troops are expected to arrive in the coming days and weeks. 
It was reported that Italy, France, Denmark and other European states are expected to join the NATO military divisions that will be led by the United States along Russias border. 
On Wednesday, Britain announced it is sending hundreds of soldiers and hardware to Russia’s borders as part of a huge military deployment. 
A total of 800 troops, drones and tanks are moving to Estonia as part of the biggest military build-up of NATO troops on Russia’s borders since the Cold War. 
In addition to the forces allocated for his specific operation, NATO has an army of over 40,000 ready to be called up to fight at any time. 
The US military claims that this threatening move is meant to act as a “deterrent” to the Russian military, but this is obvious a move that will escalate tensions and push towards a possible third world war. 
“This is a credible deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent conflict, ” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday — ironically ignoring the fact that it is a de facto provocation. 
Just imagine what would happen if Russian troops amassed along the Mexican border and told the US that this move was to ‘prevent conflict.’ 
The so-called Iskander-M cruise missiles can hit targets across Poland and the Baltics, although NATO officials declined to say if Russia had moved nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. 
The United States’ envoy to NATO, Douglas Lute told reporters that NATO and the US military may consider Russia a threat if they had nuclear weapons within range of NATO’s deployment. This statement is insane considering the fact that the US military is the ones who are many miles from home on the border of someone else’s lands. 
“This deployment, if it becomes permanent if the presence of nuclear weapons were confirmed, would be a change in (Russia’s) security posture, ” Lute said. 
If anyone is a threat, it is NATO and the US government. 
These military tensions are the result of an ongoing proxy war in Syria, in which western powers are attempting to institute a regime change in the country by funding violent rebel groups. Meanwhile, Russia has interests in keeping their allies in the Syrian government in control, putting the two superpowers at odds. 
Until now, Russia and the US have been fighting through third parties, just as they had during the previous cold war, and the same type of situation is developing today.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. 
UNESCO’s 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday’s secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris. 
Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. 
The resolution expresses UNESCO’s deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. 
Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
“Through an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem,” Erekat said. 
He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges “respecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.” 
Earlier this month, UNESCO’s 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. 
Wednesday’s vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regime’s ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel Shama-Hacohen, had been recalled for consultations. 
“We will decide what the next steps will be,” Netanyahu said in a statement. 
Elias Sanbar, Palestine’s UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were “politicizing religion and this is very dangerous.” 
Makram Mustafa Queisi, Jordan’s ambassador to UNESCO, also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a “technical point of view” while many parties were politicizing it.

Palestine became the 195th full member of UNESCO in October 2011, triggering a cut in Tel Aviv’s funding to the agency. 
The occupied territories have already been the scene of increased tensions ever since the Israeli regime imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015.

On Tuesday, Otto , the Uber-owned self-driving vehicle operation, announced the completion of its first commercial delivery, having delivered its beer load from Fort Collins, Colo., to Colorado Springs, a roughly 120-mile trip on Interstate 25. In recent years, Uber has predicted a future in which you can ride in a self-driving car that will take you where you want to go, no driver necessary. But the idea that commercial trucking could be done by robot is a relatively new idea — and a potentially controversial one, given the possibility that robots could one day replace human drivers. “We think this technology is inching closer to commercial availability,” Lior Ron, co-founder of Otto, said in an interview. In August, Uber acquired Otto, a San Francisco start-up run by a number of veterans of Google’s long-running autonomous vehicle research. Though largely symbolic, the beer delivery marks the first commercial partnership for Otto, which was founded less than a year ago. Terms of the deal between Otto and Anheuser-Busch InBev , which owns the Budweiser brand, were not disclosed. “We’ve tested with trailers, of course, but there’s nothing like actually doing the real thing, end to end,” Mr. Ron said. The delivery was indicative of Uber’s larger ambitions to become an enormous transportation network, one in which the company is responsible for moving anything, like people, hot meals or cases of beer, around the globe, at all hours and as efficiently as possible. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, has said he envisions a future in which transportation will occur in different ways, using both manned and unmanned vehicles. Otto is a particularly large bet for Uber, which paid nearly $700 million for the start-up only a few months after the company started publicly discussing its self-driving-truck ambitions. Since backing down from its money-burning effort to dominate the Chinese ride-hailing market in August, Uber has invested more time and resources to focus on breaking into the trucking market. Annual trucking industry revenue topped $720 billion in 2015, according to American Trucking Association estimates. A good part of that total came from top brands that rely heavily on the trucking industry to transport their goods. Anheuser-Busch, for example, delivers more than a million truckloads of beer domestically every year. “We view self-driving trucks as the future, and we want to be a part of that,” said James Sembrot, senior director of logistics strategy at Anheuser-Busch. Though the delivery went smoothly, the two companies did not indicate whether there would be any further deals. For this initial delivery, Otto’s truck departed Anheuser-Busch’s facility in Loveland, Colo., in the early morning before reaching the interstate in Fort Collins. The truck drove through Denver — alongside regular passenger car traffic — and navigated to its destination in Colorado Springs without incident. Otto said a trained driver was in the cabin of the truck at all times to monitor the vehicle’s progress and take over if necessary. At no point was the driver required to intervene, the company said. Future expansion of the pilot program will allow Otto to test for more types of road and weather conditions, a major factor in autonomous vehicle route plotting.",english,2016-10-26T23:44:13.463+03:00,fromthetrenchesworldreport.com,US,,Self-Driving Truck’s First Mission: A 120-Mile Beer Run,0,http://www.fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/images/default-user-image.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Brooding and bearded face shadowed by an odd hat, cutlass scars on his arms and a dark patch where his eye ought to be. The pirate is a familiar stereotype. Countless movies have worn him down to a smooth and unremarkable cliche. 
But what if that cliche has depths that have yet to be mined by the movie industry? 
That is the question that Israeli-American director Arnon Z. Shorr (Blood and Stone: A Legend of the Golem, A Modest Suggestion, Glimpse) has chosen to tap into with the Pirate Captain Toledano . Beneath the pirate's hat hides another sort of hat. A Jewish one. For the Pirate Captain Toledano is a Jewish pirate. What sort of Jew becomes a pirate and why? 
Touching on true history, that is one of the questions that Shorr's film proposes to answer. 
Recent years have seen growing interest in the history of Jewish pirates. And what initially seems absurd quickly becomes a fascinating exploration of how much of history is lost when legend becomes cliche. As a pioneering filmmaker, Arnon Z. Shorr has chosen to tackle this ambitious project with the aid of two vessels at the Ocean Institute, a dedicated cast and support from the public. 
Though the process of bringing the Pirate Captain Toledano from vision to reality has only begun, the journey has already been marked by fortuitous coincidences, including the discovery that cast member Stephen DeCordova (Captain Toledano) hailed from ancestors who were Jewish pirates and a treasured Kiddush cup in his possession, which likely dates back from those days, will play a key role in the story. 
Like the ocean, history has unseen depths and strange currents that can only be glimpsed from the right angle. Arnon Z. Shorr is currently laboring to bring up a lost piece of history from the deeps.",english,2016-10-27T04:21:35.434+03:00,frontpagemag.com,US,34811,Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean,0,http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/10/shooting_crowdfunding_video267.jpg?itok=hKpgo1cI,0,1,0,0,0,hate

Bovendien 
Former Defense Minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, has filed a lawsuit along with several others at the State Canada on the CETA treaty. CETA stands for comprehensive economic and trade agreement, a trade which are entered according to prosecutors constitutional and international rights of people with feet. Paul Hellyer called the treaty therefore Comprehensive Trade and Takeover Agreement. With this convention, which comes out of the hat of the international bankers, 62 families will obtain control over almost the entire world. Constitutions of member countries will no longer apply, only the will of the 62 families (the elite) will apply. 
The lawsuit was officially filed on October 21 of this year and actually consists of four 
namely separate indictments; the federal government does not have the constitutional authority to sign, execute and implement treaties without the express prior authority of Parliament through an Act of Parliament 
the federal government has no constitutional right to sign CETA and / or perform without having this treaty first by the Parliament through official channels. (2) the solid majority of the CETA articles and Their Impact encroach on exclusive Provincial spheres or forum-protected by the division of powers under the Constitution Act, 1867 
Most of the CETA provisions and their impact undermine exclusive legal rights protected by the Canadian Constitutional Law, 1867 the CETA gouge and extinguishes the constitutionally protected Judiciary in Canada by creating foreign tribunals to determining property and legal issues in Canada without any judicial oversight or Jurisdiction of the Canadian Courts over the disputes; and 
CETA removes the constitutional legal system by setting foreign tribunals have to judge between property and other legal issues without overlooked may be the Canadian legal system, and various articles of the CETA violate constitutional enshrined rights in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms , and over-rides Charter Guarantees That ground Canada’s ability to mount public programs on Health, Education, Social Services, and public utilities-including the elimination of subsidies, monopolies, and state enterprises for public welfare. In short, the treaty places the rights of private foreign investors about Those of the Canadian Constitution and Canadian citizens. 
various provisions of CETA violated constitutional built-rights enshrined in the document Charter of Rights and Freedoms and transcend guaranteed rights that Canada has the opportunity to develop public programs in the fields of health, education, social services and public funds, including the termination of subsidies , monopolies and state enterprises for the public interest. In short, the treaty puts the interests of private foreign companies over those of the Canadian constitution and its inhabitants. 
But this is not all! Paul Hellyer, which is so you can immediately see and hear his call to Canadians and the rest of the world, his mind has put on the roll of the largest crime syndicate has ever known the world, the international bankers, international intertwined the main industries in which the owners of the revenues come from only 62 families. 
Paul Hellyer remembers the Canada which was separate from the bankers, yet not so long ago. Until 1974 the Canadian government expressed its money itself, there was no such thing as inflation, poverty and debt. Canada was one of the largest financiers behind the allies that Europe was liberated from the Germans at that time. Life was good, cheap and everyone had enough money to do the things they wanted to do. From one day to the issued money creation in 1974 the central banks and money was no longer free. Within a few years, Canada had a huge debt that is recovered just as us on the civilian population through numerous taxes. Paul Hellyer has evidence that this happened in unconstitutional manner and wants to decide turn back to Canada to give it right back himself pressing her money to spend. This affects every Canadian citizen a large sum of money to free education, health, housing, etc. can be paid without causing debts. Paul Hellyer does the same as Foundation for Our Money aims but in a turbo version! He lets no grass grow, does not perform educational skits for the people who maintain this crime for years, Paul Hellyer goes straight for the scapegoat. 
Now the video of Paul Hellyer where he explains personally exactly what is going on and how they want to approach this. 
Dear readers. This could be the big break. This information should be shared very broadly as to all countries under the thumb are the bankers, the same applies. We can deliver all of this unfair system where our benefit only a handful of people. The power over the creation of money is a sovereign matter since no one has more to do with it. We want a better and fairer world, then this is the opportunity that everyone has been waiting for! 
Privatized money is the reason for all wars, privatized money is the cause of poverty, oppression, exploitation, neglect of our elderly and less fortunate. Privatized money is the root of all evil on this beautiful planet. Now is the chance to get out from under the yoke, to stand up for the future of ourselves and our children. Now is the chance to rid the world of those people who make a huge mess for over 100 years with one goal, to keep the creation of money in their hands and with it the power over almost anything this planet has to offer.

By Lisa Brown, 10/19/2016 I find it interesting to experience/observe. I can see their desire to expose/honor their hearts, yet their confusion at losing their masculine persona if they do. I can see their beauty, magnificence and purity of their soul and their not knowing how to BE a MAN and feel all this stuff emerging within them. I can also see them put stronger walls up trying their best to hold on to old realities not true anymore, fear of feeling, hurt, failure and losing control, letting anyone in, being let down, abandoned, judged….. which do not occur on NEW Earth. 
It is no different than when we woke up (women and feminine energy men), yet it is, for they’ve lived this life of strength, of being powerful, of being strong and surviving everything. For the really really masculine energy man (or women, but we are talking about men right now), their softness brings forth fear of vulnerability….. which is so totally the opposite, for we must allow ourselves that rawness/that vulnerability in order to truly feel again, to bring the walls of protection down, to not live in the fear of being alone…. 
When our soul awakens, we desire connection, deeply, yet we seek it in others first. Experience after experience activates our unworthiness, feeling of not-good-enough, lack of intimate lasting connection, rejected for not being “enough” in others minds, where they are not in-tune with their own sacred soul. 
WE are in the vibrations of the very masculine man awakening now…. more and more. It’s important to support them, show them that they can be masculine and honor their soul at the same time. It’s important to open up and share, to show them it’s safe to be seen. It’s important to not impose, not pressure, not push… just hold the space for them to open up on their own and not feel threatened as they do. It’s important for the women to support the men now, yet in very different ways than before. 
Those who have opened their hearts KNOW that our relationships are very different here. We do not hold attachments, cords, expectations or needs anymore. All New Earth relationships are powerful, beautiful, freeing, supportive, empowering, inspiring and a co-creative experience of in-service to ourselves, each other and all on earth. They are to usher in the new era, this one now, through unity, peace, respect, support, contribution and Divine Love. 
Many men have been trying to wake up, going through their distortions, shedding old human needs and exchanging them for new desires to take their place in this new world now. The more human masculine energy, the more safety, protection and survival mechanisms there were. Judgment is huge and it’s scary when your whole world starts to change for you and you don’t have a choice anymore. 
Women, it’s your time to step-up, to BE the one that already understands. To BE the one who holds that space and the STABILITY in place. When the old starts to collapse, crumble, dissolve, when emotions start to surface that you didn’t know were there, when nothing makes sense and you don’t understand why you can’t keep it together anymore and be the one that everyone could depend on physically…. we all know what this is like… we’ve been there. 
We’ve been through the collapse to move into creation of the new. To re-birth ourselves, our own realities and now the men do this too. There are many who were not ready before, yet those times (vibrations) are gone. You will start to see more men awaken, especially the strong ones, and the fear of “how” to deal with this… part of your job as an Ascended BEing, as a Master BEing, as a Light Tower and a Keeper of NEW Earth is to not just hold the space but show them how it’s all not only going to be okay, it’s going to be awesome. 
It doesn’t matter what body we are in, female or male. Men now identify with their masculine bodies as an expectation that they are supposed to be the strong one, the providers, the one’s that don’t break…. when we know better…. 
When the soul awakens, the human aspect does break/dissolve, and it doesn’t matter what bodies we are in. This process is genderless… We all have human masculine, human feminine and we have Divine Masculine and Divine Feminine too. 
Relationships built or formed out of unconsciousness collapse, end, re-shape or transform, often all of these….. Some go their separate ways while each evolves, awakens, dies/re-births/grows up as Spirit/Soul in physical body form. 
Many women’s/partner’s/friend’s roles will be to support others and super masculine man now ready to open up. Just because they struggled before, resisted before, doesn’t mean they still are/will. When you show them (WayShower) that you can handle it, you can be the support, you can even be the provider if need be, then they can honor themselves without the weight of everyone depending on them to do it all by themselves anymore. 
As masculine/feminine are re-defined, according to ENERGY and that each can fill all of these roles themselves, then the balance can shift easily, and each as they honor themselves and step up into their own roles, can support others ready to do this too. 
Financial support is also a part of this, which can be emasculating if viewed through human eyes. When one realizes that money is just energy to support us all, they let go of the mis-perceptions and definitions once held by who did what role. In the old paradigm, Money was associated with power, which was a masculine thing. NOW money is an expression of gratitude, love, respect, contribution and is to support those stepping into/fulfilling their SOUL’s Purposes and Roles here. When the focus is taken off of money and put on what is truly important, the SOUL, then each can flourish, each can receive, each can share, each contributes the ENERGY of what is important to create a whole new reality of UNIFIED EXISTENCE here. 
Strength is through the purely open true warrior heart. Power is the knowledge and wisdom that comes through your own connection AS PURE SOURCE LIGHT within. Abundance is an existence. Divine Sacred Love is what makes the difference here. Union is when Souls come together, to work together, to be together and to bring forth realities consciously together. We all have to/had to do this ourselves so that we could create/anchor/hold the foundation of a whole new/remembered existence here. 
Your SOUL can see the awakening Soul of another. You can expand the space or shut it down/close portals. What’s appropriate will be determined by how conscious, present and open each is…. As a Master, you have the capability to see, understand and do more than you did as a limited and lacking human. Your energy makes the difference…………. They are going to need to pull away, be alone, sleep and have someone to talk to without being judged. The human aspect doesn’t believe it’s safe to open up, without being attacked, judged or imposed upon. It’s up to you to show that it is. Masculine energy believes it when they see it. You prove it by BEing your higher self all of the time. Their soul will emerge as you do. 
Higher Consciousness Existence. I love you.

Some report being strip-searched in custody at the Morton County jail, even when they’re facing minor misdemeanor charges. This is Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : When I was taken to the jail, first I was taken by a corrections officer, transported from the protest site to the Morton County jail. And then, when they took me in there, you know, they had to take some basic information. And then, one of the things that they do is have you go into a small room, and there was a female officer there, and we had to—I had to take my clothes off, and then, I don’t know, basically— 
AMY GOODMAN : Cavity search? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : No, not a cavity search, but I had to squat and cough. That’s what she said. I had to squat and cough and then put the orange suit on. 
AMY GOODMAN : So you were put in an orange jumpsuit? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : Yeah, I was put in an orange jumpsuit. And then I was held there for several hours. And initially, you know, my family didn’t know where I was or didn’t—you know, they heard about it pretty quickly and were able to come and bond me out or bail me out. I don’t know what you call it. But I was in there for several hours. 
AMY GOODMAN : How did it make you feel? 
DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE : It made me feel—you know, it made me think about my ancestors and what had they gone through. And this was in no way a comparison to what we’ve survived before, so just made me feel more determined about what I’m doing and why I’m here. 
AMY GOODMAN : That’s Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician, member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. She was charged with disorderly conduct. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who founded the first resistance camp, the Sacred Stone Camp, on her own land April 1st, says her daughter was recently arrested, taken into custody at the Morton County jail, strip-searched in front of multiple male officers, then left for hours in her cell, naked and freezing, before the guards finally gave her clothes to wear. LaDonna Allard says her daughter was repeatedly asked by guards, “Who is your mother?” which Allard sees as an indication that her daughter was targeted because of who she is. Cody Hall from Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota says he was also strip-searched after he was arrested Friday, September 9th, held for three days without bail or bond, and then charged with two misdemeanors. 
CODY HALL : As I exited out of the vehicles and entered Morton County, I came up an elevator, and as the elevator opened up, I was met with state police. And then, you know, of course, Morton County people were there to book people, but—and then, from there, started the process of the booking, and then, again, you know, went into a private room, where they ask you to, you know, get naked. You know, they had my arms. They, you know, kind of like extend your arms out. And you’re fully naked. And they have you, you know, lift up your genitals and bend over, you know, cough. And so, it’s really one of those tactics that they try to break down your mentalness of everyday life, because not every day do you wake up and say, “Hey, I’m going to get, you know, naked and have somebody search me today,” you know? That’s a private—you know, that’s a private feeling for you, when you get naked, so… 
AMY GOODMAN : And four days later, when you were finally released—they hadn’t allowed you to go out on bail or bond for those four days—you came before a judge in the orange jumpsuit? 
CODY HALL : Yes, yes, I sat in the court office in my orange jumpsuit, locked, you know, still handcuffed, exited out of the courtroom. And as I left the courtroom, there were 20 or so state police all in their bullet-proof vests, everything just looking, you know, like—you know, like they’re going into action of some sort. And then they literally had a line from the courtroom to the door that connects you to the county jail. And my mother walked out with me. And as we got to the door, they were opening the door up. And as I looked behind me, my mother and I, all of the cops then proceeded to kind of swarm, you know, like make, you know, that big wall as I entered in, which was, again, an overkill, you know, but that, too, though, to show a dominant force. 
AMY GOODMAN : That was Cody Hall, who was arrested on two misdemeanors, held for four days, strip-searched here at the Morton County jail just behind us. 
Well, for more on the resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline and the police crackdown, we’re joined by two guests. Winona LaDuke, Native American activist, executive director of the group Honor the Earth, she lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. And we’re joined by Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. She is Ojibwe from the Couchiching First Nation. 
We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Winona, let’s start with you. We have spoken to you intermittently through this resistance. Where does it stand now? 
WINONA LADUKE : Well, as far as we are in—I mean, I’m just looking at the big picture. Right now there is about 900,000 barrels per day of oil coming out of this state, and they project that into 2019. And so, what I’m trying to understand is, is that if that’s all they have and it’s already going out, why do they need another pipeline of 570,000 barrels of oil per day? In other words, they’re already meeting all their demand. For the next two years, that’s all the oil that’s in there. And this is really—what we call this is the Dakota Excess pipeline. 
AMY GOODMAN : The Dakota Excess. 
WINONA LADUKE : Dakota Excess pipeline. This is really about spites. It’s really about spite. 
AMY GOODMAN : What do you mean? 
WINONA LADUKE : It’s just really about hating. You know, it’s just really about trying to put something in across these tribes. It’s exactly what the chairman and you said before: If they wanted this pipeline so damn bad, they should have put it north of Bismarck, you know, and they should have—they should not have violated the law. The whole pipeline was approved through something called the Nationwide Permit number 12, which means they could it into a lot of little pieces and never do an EIS , and pretend like—you know, that’s intended for like if you have like a pipeline from a school to the water service center or something like that. It’s not intended for a 1,600-mile pipeline. Total misuse of the law, you know, and the president really needs to intervene and uphold the law…Read more and watch video at Democracy Now!",english,2016-10-26T22:09:37.956+03:00,galacticconnection.com,US,,"Dakota Excess Pipeline?

The process of clearing this land of its human vermin continues. The minions of this realm remain easy to find and arrest. They truly believe that the Light cannot obstruct their positions of power. Swiftly, they are discovering an awful truth. Their errant ways can no longer be tolerated. The rule of the dark is quickly ending and being replaced by various versions of “GESARA.” When the clearing of this unholy riff-raff is complete, those who hold the funds are to easily let this immense wealth run its course across this globe. You are to receive an abundance that is to forever end the wicked hoarding of the dark and its foolish minions. Never forget how the dark so evilly prevented you from receiving the resources that you urgently need to remake this reality. It is vital that you see this immense wealth as a way to ensure that your dreams come true. It is your confident and successful dreaming that is to allow you to let go of your unfounded fears and continuing belief that you are less than others. You are all a wondrous union of potential that needs to manifest in every way possible. 
Be able to see yourself as a most valuable member of this global union and learn of your sovereign right to manifest your dreams. That is how this collective can produce creative solutions for a new reality. You have within you a profound wisdom. Do not think your dreams are unworthy. You are an important part of this collection of surface humanity. Constantly connect to one another and in so doing, realize how this continually flowing set is contributing to the changing of the whole. Adopt a position where you intuitively realize that this never-ending operation is framing your new reality. We are here, as is Heaven, to oversee this process. Feel free to contribute your own wonderfulness to this organic whole. Let the old ways and beliefs go. This is to be a new time, filled with freedom and prosperity. You need to let go of the control issues planted in you so meticulously by the dark. Welcome the playfulness of the Light and discover the magnificence of who you really are. This is just the precursor for this new age of spiritual discovery! 
This new age of discovery is really about understanding how the Light creates its realities. You are quickly learning this, and getting a glimpse into its exquisite intricacies. This new life of yours is to be founded upon your dreams and the operation of the Light within. You have long been in denial of how to transform by learning to truly be yourself. Long ago, you were a picture of inner creativity. The limits taught by those around you began at first to hinder you. Later, those limits turned into the walls that now enclose you. This imposed sense of limitation needs to be cracked open and totally abandoned. Instead, you require a new prototype. One that, seeing again your primitive playfulness, lets it take over. You feel, somehow, that this process is inappropriate. You need to end this feeling. Replace it with a need to see just how you can measure where you fit into the whole. This gauge is within you. Spirit gave it to you when you were born. All that is required is to know how to recognize it. This is the task that our mentors intend to explore with you. 
Begin, therefore, to explore how it feels to be limitless in your resources. Look inside and, with intent, carefully explore your priorities for each of your dreams and how they fit into a magnificent whole. Use this grand framework to determine how you wish to manifest them. This, of course, is just a start. Look around and discuss all of this with your closest friends and family. We intend to fully expand this with you. Our mentors’ first task is to allow you to let go of fears and any other deep perceptions that can limit you. Our desire is to have you discover how amazing you truly are. This process is needed to empower you to eliminate your old perceptions. Ever bear in mind that you have an immense potential that is to be expanded to whatever you are able to perceive. This potential is a major element that your mentor is to weave and then explore with you. This operation may take some time to fully understand. We therefore intend to show you how this plan can open you to comprehensively fulfill your dreams. In this lies the key to your vast potential! 
Namaste! We are your Ascended Masters! We come to emphasize the fact that your realm is changing for the better. Those who doubt this change need only look around and see that the posturing of the dark and its many minions has yielded nothing but distraught hopes for a success that is now truly unattainable. It is essential that those who hold visions similar to our own realize that this new world is indeed at hand! Let us together request first of Heaven and then demand of our governments that a system of governance be implemented for all to see. Heaven set up a timetable with the dark. The time draws near, Dear Ones, when this miracle is to manifest. Therefore be ready to explain, when approached, that the new ways come to rejoice! In this joy we can all leave undisturbed the years of frustration. Let go of all the tragedy that surrounds you. This is a time when your many dreams are to manifest and the old ways are finally to be done with. Let this bell of freedom ring out again and again throughout this realm! 
Each of you since childhood has had a series of special wishes that were modified many times as you grew older. Liberate these grand visions. Acknowledge how deeply they can bring you great joy. Heaven sincerely wishes to make all of this happen. The wealth and benefits that make it possible for this to be realized are what all in Heaven intend to accomplish. The exalted Creator of all has been decreeing this for millennia. As we have mentioned before, a divine timetable is in effect. This time has been divinely set. This sacred time is near. We Masters are doing all that is necessary to bring this glorious moment to Gaia. Developments are currently underway to achieve this sacred event. Thus, it is necessary for you to bring forth your light so that this event may unfold now. Thus, it is essential that all be diligent in manifesting the last grand event. Please persevere in this task. 
Long ago, the surface of this realm seemed extremely dismal. The Anunnaki were everywhere. Their dark deeds, intensified by the insanity of ritual murders and constant war, were the rule of the day. In the past century and a half, this darkness has begun slowly to lift. Now you are at the very edge of the Age of Light. What at one time seemed impossible is to occur. Now that this growing consciousness has reached a general awareness, some mighty miracles are coming to pass. Continue to work for the Light! Know that the darkness is slipping away. We Masters notice this every day. Become ever more confident of this. The dark is being forced to relinquish its torture of you. Potential wars will not come to fruition. An aura of peace is descending upon this blessed land. A time for wondrous events to suddenly appear is indeed near. Never lose your faith! Remain positive and expect even more miracles to occur! 
Today, we have reported yet again what is unfolding around this precious orb! Announcements for many things long wished for are in place! A new time for all is upon us! Be prepared to be a most joyous part of this! Know, dear Ones, that the countless supply and never-ending prosperity of Heaven are indeed yours! So Be It! Selamat Gajun! Selamat Ja!

Project Hemisphere, a secretive program developed by AT&T, searches trillions of call records in order to analyze cell phone data, spying on the activity of private individuals in order to identify who they are speaking with and why, as well as GPS tracking on the location of each individual connected to the call, and it transmits this information to the Department of Justice (DOJ). 
In 2013, Project Hemisphere was shown in a PowerPoint presentation produced by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The New York Times reported this as a partnership between AT&T and the DOJ, primarily deployed for drug-enforcement task-forces. All information collected in this program is accessible to the federal agencies authorized by the DOJ. 
AT&T specifically developed and marketed this product for use by the DOJ, who would promise hundreds of millions in funds on behalf of taxpayers, using the taxpayers’ own money to spy on their every move. This is an invasion of privacy without a warrant. This is a federal spy program by proxy, working through corporations. 
AT&T promises law enforcement that it will not disclose Project Hemisphere’s involvement in active investigations that are made public. AT&T is is attempting to lower liability for their customer and limit scrutiny to information transmitted to federal agencies through their network. 
While it should not be surprising that your cell phone company is working with bureaucrats to collect incriminating evidence on you, there is a staggering number of people who still carelessly use their cell phone as if the information being transmitted through the device will be kept private. 
News flash! It’s never been private. They have always wanted to use your information as a product to sell to the highest bidder.

Select Page After terrorizing America with Zika scaremongering, Washington Post now admits Zika virus doesn’t cause brain deformities after all 
Posted by Madeline | Oct 26, 2016 | 2016 , Daily Blog | 0 | Thanks Nancy!
Natural News 
(NaturalNews) The entire leftist media is not merely dishonest and corrupt, their science writers are unbelievably stupid and ill-informed about nearly everything in the natural world. Today, after months of printing fear-inducing “Zika terrorism” stories that scared America half to death while convincing the government to funnel billions of dollars into Zika vaccine research for Big Pharma, the Washington Post now admits it had no idea what it was talking about . 
But rather than admitting its own science writers were scientifically illiterate propagandists pushing quack narratives as news, the paper now blames other scientists for the gross error by publishing a headline that’s once again dishonest and deceptive: “Scientists are bewildered by Zika’s path across Latin America,” it proclaims. 
Bewildered about “Zika’s path?” The story headline should actually read, “Zika HOAX revealed… it doesn’t cause brain damage after all.” (Read it at this link .) Washington Post has been shamelessly pushing the Zika HOAX for months… with no apology to readers 
In the story, writers Dom Phillips and Nick Miroff essentially reveal that what the Washington Post has been writing about the Zika virus has been based entirely in government propaganda and pandemic lies pushed by the CDC, which of course has close ties to the criminal vaccine industry: 
Nearly nine months after Zika was declared a global health emergency, the virus has infected at least 650,000 people in Latin America and the Caribbean, including tens of thousands of expectant mothers. 
But to the great bewilderment of scientists, the epidemic has not produced the wave of fetal deformities so widely feared when the images of misshapen infants first emerged from Brazil. 
Yes, the Washington Post now says the scientists are “bewildered” that their apocalyptic scare stories that caused female athletes to skip out on the Rio Olympics and scared tens of millions of Americans into poisoning themselves with DEET (a neurotoxic chemical) turned out to be total hogwash. DEET, by the way, combines with carbamate class pesticides to cause neurological dysfunction in humans , which coincidentally increases the number of people who watch CNN or read the Washington Post. 
For the record, no one who reads Natural News is surprised by this revelations that has left mainstream scientists “bewildered.” It’s not bewildering to me. I called Zika a total hoax from day one, pointing out that the brain deformities were caused by larvacide chemicals dumped into the water supply , not by Zika. See some of my stories that clearly spelled all this out months before the Washington Post had any clue what they were writing about: 
March 2, 2016: Zika PAYDAY! Obama wants to funnel $1.8 billion for vaccine research and more 
I even published a mini-documentary revealing the published science that shows how DEET insecticide causes brain damage in humans. You can watch it at this link or view the video below: 
If anyone from the Washington Post bothered to read Natural News and learn about real science, they would have learned that Zika has infected tens of millions of people throughout South America for decades , with absolutely no measurable increase in neurological deformations. (But facts be damned, the WashPost had a panic to push!) Nation after nation records tens of thousands of infections with ZERO birth defects… 
Despite the factual reality of the situation, the state-controlled propagandists writing for rags like the Washington Post — a bogus newspaper that has lost all credibility in the minds of intelligent people — continued to pummel home their kooky science theories that claimed much of the U.S. South would be overrun by brain damaging mosquitoes, turning Southerners into shrunken-brained mutants while pregnant women fled northward to survive the airborne insect onslaught. 
Instead, nothing happened . No explosion in shrunken-headed babies. No wave of birth defects across Florida, even as city officials desperately bombarded their own cities with brain-damaging insecticides. No national emergency declared by Obama to bring back DDT and eradicate baby-murdering mosquitoes by dousing our open streets with thick clouds of organophosphate neurotoxins. 
Instead, the rate of neurological birth defects in most countries approached zero. Via the Washington Post’s own graphic: (partial list) 
Venezuela: 60,791 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects Honduras: 31,933 Zika infections… ONE birth defect Guadalupe: 30,969 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects Puerto Rico: 29,084 Zika infections… TWO birth defects Mexico: 4,837 Zika infections… ZERO birth defects 
From the WashPost article: 
Brazilian officials were bracing for a flood of fetal deformities as Zika spread this year to other regions of the country, Marinho said. However, “we are not seeing a big increase.” 
Gee, really? 
The vast majority of the brain defects, it turns out, came from just one small region of Brazil. A total of 2,033 children are so far recorded with neurological defects there, even while most other countries throughout the region had ZERO birth defects (or near zero). 
So what gives? Zika mosquitoes apparently carry geopolitical maps so they can solely target Brazil 
You don’t have to be a genius to figure out that the stupid science theories of the mainstream media are total hokum and bunk . If Zika really did cause brain defects, it would have spread all across South America by now. It would have spread into Florida, California, Mississippi and Louisiana. It would have devastated the American South, Cuba, Haiti, Curacao and all the other island nations across the Caribbean. 
Yet the neurological defects were limited almost exclusively to Brazil. 
Somehow, if we believe the illiterate Washington Post science writers — who may in fact be the only brain damage victims of Zika in North America — mosquitoes carry MAPS to make sure they only activate their brain damage voodoo in Brazil . 
“…[A]lthough the outbreak has spread this year to more than 50 nations and territories across the Western Hemisphere, U.N. data shows just 142 cases of congenital birth defects linked to Zika so far outside Brazil,” says WashPost. 
Yes, my friends: GPA-carrying Zika mosquitoes are very careful to limit their pandemic voodoo to just one region of Brazil. By sheer coincidence, that’s the same region where larvacide chemicals were dumped into the public water supply. 
Apparently, there isn’t a single “official” scientist in the entire global government who has thought to test the water. Just freaking WOW… Let’s throw these morons out of power in every election, okay? They don’t deserve any positions of authority over anyone else. They’re all so incredibly stupid, they couldn’t survive at all unless they functioned as parasites on the taxpayers. They aren’t giving up hope just yet… science writers desperately hope for more brain damaged babies to prove them right 
Enthusiasm for more brain damaged babies runs high at the Washington Post, which explains why they are all in for Hillary Clinton, the candidate of choice for brain damaged adults . Writing with a sense of real enthusiasm, the Washington Post can’t wait for more brain damaged babies to appear: 
Scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are closely watching Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 26,800 cases of Zika. More than 7,000 pregnant women could be infected by the end of the year, according to the CDC. (Yippee?) 
And now, the loony tunes quack science of the Zika “scientists” goes apoplectic, grasping for silly metaphors to try to obscure the fact that they are all stupid beyond belief . Via the WashPost: 
“Now we’ve settled on Zika as the smoking gun, but we don’t know who pulled the trigger,” said Marques, speaking from Recife, where he is working with government researchers. 
Huh? Wha? The metaphor doesn’t even make any sense. 
Maybe the problem is too much fornicating. Seriously, this is now part of their idiotic theory: 
“Sexual habits and hygiene may also play a role,” he said, explaining that researchers are looking at whether sexual transmission can infect the uterus and placenta with the virus, potentially exposing the fetus to elevated risk. “We suspect the villain has an accomplice, but we don’t know who it is,” Marques said. 
Huh? Do they seriously think that people only have sex in Brazil but not other South American countries? Where does the Washington Post find these morons? I’m a real scientist saying all this 
As you read all this, remember that I have rapidly become one of the world’s leading research scientists on the quantitation of cannabinoids in hemp extracts using mass spec instrumentation. I led the team that developed the most pioneering (and accurate) CBD mass spec analysis method in existence today. You can read about it at this link . I also routinely test water, food and environmental samples for heavy metals, pesticides and a multitude of chemical contaminants. When I say these Zika scientists are complete morons, that’s the educated opinion of an accomplished scientist correctly pointing out the lunacy of Zika scaremongering. 
I could have solved this entire problem in the first few days by analyzing and detecting brain-damaging larvacide chemicals in the public water supply in Eastern Brazil. The entire project would have taken just a few days and cost almost nothing. Instead, Obama handed $1.8 billion to the vaccine companies in the midst of the Zika panic pushed by laughable rags like the Washington Post. It’s all a racket, of course, just like their coverage of elections and political candidates. Everything you read at the Washington Post is a deception of one kind or another . The paper exists solely to promote the propaganda of the state so that the population can be manipulated and controlled. The Washington Post exists to terrorize the citizens with fascist propaganda parading as science 
As you’ve also learned by now, the corrupt leftist establishment of junk science, criminal politicians and idiotic journalists isn’t interested in legitimate scientific solutions . They all function as extensions of a fascist state that must routinely terrorize its citizens with pandemic boogeyman scare stories in order to demand absolute obedience to the vaccine mandates that actually do damage the brains of children. 
Thus, SCIENCE be damned. They’ve got an agenda to push, and it doesn’t matter to them whether that agenda is based on a single shred of real science. Zika is dangerous because they told you so, in exactly the same way they told you Hillary Clinton is totally honest, Obamacare would make health care more affordable, there’s no such thing as voter fraud in America, and GMOs and vaccines are really, really good for you. 
So you can put down the DEET and stop poisoning your skin like an obedient idiot. Yes, it was all a scam. Yes, the official “science” was totally rigged. Yes, the media lied to you yet again. Yes, the CDC is a criminal racket. Yes, all the health “officials” were completely full of s**t. And no, Zika is not going to cause your babies to be born with shrunken heads. VACCINES, on the other hand, will most definitely cause brain damage, as they still contain mercury, a potent neurotoxin the Washington Post ridiculously insists becomes magically neutralized when you inject it into the body of a child.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), seeking to promote the peaceful use of Nuclear Power , in 2011 established with the Regional Cooperative Agreement (RCA) Member States, a joint IAEA Technical Cooperation (TC) project in the region of the Pacific Ocean. 
It was established after the Fukushima disaster when a tsunami caused by a major earthquake on 11 March 2011, disabled the power supply and cooling of three Fukushima Daiichi reactors, causing a nuclear accident. 
As a result, a large quantity of radioactive material was admitted into the Pacific Ocean. A field study found that two filter cartridges were coated, which showed elements of cesium, a radioactive substance. 
Of no surprise, this caused great concern to countries based around the Pacific Ocean due to the potential economic and environmental implications. The TC project’s aim was therefore, to monitor the presence of radioactive substances in the marine environment. 
The first annual review meeting held in August 2012 demonstrated predictive hydrodynamic models and they predicted that the strong current, known as the Kuroshio Current and its extension, had the ability to transport the radioactive substances across the Pacific Ocean in an easterly direction. 
However, the concentration of radioactivity was not as high as originally thought. 
The massive expansion of ocean had diluted it substantially so radioactivity remained at low levels but there was still concern over contamination of seafood even at these low levels. 
The marine monitoring project was therefore, established to ensure that the seafood of the region was safe for consumption and to maintain a comprehensive overview and full facts of the situation, considering its grave implications. Documents Say Navy Knew #Fukushima Dangerously Contaminated the USS Reagan: http://t.co/hUomqT92e2

The TC is due to conclude this year. A few results have caused concern. 
A field study they conducted on 2 July 2014, revealed from two sets of seawater samples, found that two filter cartridges were coated, which showed elements of cesium, a radioactive substance. 
Then recently, trace amounts of cesium-134 and cesium-137 turned up in samples collected near Vancouver Island in British Columbia . 
The samples collected were separate from the monitoring project set up by IAEA but it is thought the only possible source of these radioactive elements is Fukushima, according to the Integrated Fukushima Ocean Radionuclide Monitoring (InFORM) Network. 
This is the first time that traces of cesium-134 had been detected near North America. 
While these are trace amounts, the danger of radioactive material in any amount cannot be underestimated. However, the experts say that these levels detected cannot really harm us, they are still lower than those we could be exposed to from a dental x-ray for instance. 
Having said that, every possible exposure, in any small amount, adds up. The problem with nuclear energy and fallout, the radiation and radioactive materials can travel far and wide with the wind and with the sea. 
Therefore, we should aim on a global level to keep these levels at zero. In any event the continuous monitoring of oceans will need to be conducted, according to Ken Buesseler, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute . 
What Buesseler says should be taken on board beyond 2015, particularly since the advice from the IAEA is to dump even more contaminated water into the sea. This is apparently more desirable than holding it in tanks. 
Any discharge will have to be controlled and continuous monitoring would be needed, in particular near the plant to improve data reliability. 
This is causing concern and not just to state authorities. Consider the fishermen. Every time they catch fish in the ocean, the fish need to be tested for radioactivity. 
Before any further dumping is done, the IAEA and Tokyo Electric Power Co., who control the plant, need to consider not only the environmental impact but socio-economic impact as well. 
Livelihoods could be affected as well as long-term health of the region and global community eventually.",english,2016-10-26T23:22:02.757+03:00,galacticconnection.com,US,,Officials: Fukushima Has Now Contaminated 1/3 of the Worlds Oceans,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Feeling it comin’? New Moon in Scorpio this weekend sets the tone for the month ahead, themes, needs, issues, etc. And that means “shadow work,” looking at all the deep dark needs, feelings, fears, and impulses that, when still unconscious, take us where we really don’t want to go and cause effects we regret in the future. So onward and upward is feeling, talking about, expressing, and just flat out being aware of ourselves. 
Whether you agree or disagree with the observations made in this video I hope they are food for thought and a springboard for further discussion within your circles of relationship. In this way, we can all become more aware of the socio-cultural-religious-educational conditioning going on so as to identify more clearly for ourselves and our children just what kind of life we want to propagate on this planet! Injoy!

The “modern day marvel.” The machines are taking over The candidates in the current campaign – or any campaign – are all promising to “bring back good jobs” to “create good jobs.” When asked how they would do that, they are all a little light on details.About a year ago, Joe Biden was in Michigan to celebrate the opening of a new manufacturing plant that made “small metal clamps” used in all kinds of industries to hold wiring, hoses. Etc. in place. The largest market is the auto industry but they are sold to hundreds of other manufacturers. Depending on size, shape, and material, these parts sell for a few pennies or less. You have to make a lot of these parts to have any substantial billing numbers.This new plant is fully automated and runs 24/7/365 with just 14 people. Joe was quite happy saying “manufacturing is returning to America.”However, there is a backstory. That plant had been around for years. It had employed 600 people on two shifts. Then, the Chinese began to undercut the pricing, and the plant was no longer profitable and closed. Two years later, it reopened as a fully automated plant and regained the business because it could now manufacture cheaper than the Chinese.There are several stories inside the main story.The first story is about the initial plant closing. Anytime 600 people lose their jobs, you know that some employee ended up losing their home, that some cars were reprocessed, that some college kid had to quit school, etc. Retailers got hit. Utilities at the plant were no longer needed. Suppliers got hit too.More at [ My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance."" 09",english,2016-10-26T21:22:07.260+03:00,godlikeproductions.com,US,12387,Why the Jobs Aren’t Coming Back.

What are you fucking stupid eating that bullshit? You look like an idiot.3. Nuclear Codes. What a bunch of shit. First, Hillary is an old ill woman who has seizures, can't stand up, can't hear, and when she testifies before Congress claims she can't remember anything that happened. So....you are worried about Trump with the Nuclear Codes?Oh, yah, and she was Sect. of State exactly while the US policy in the Middle East went to shit, created ISIS and directly caused the greatest Human disaster since World War II which is now threatening to spread terrrorists all over Europe and the US. AND SHE IS COMPLETELY CLUELESS ABOUT IT. She will tell you that we need to be kind and nice to the religion of peace OR it will Cause Terrorism. Oh Ya? Well Obama did it your way...AND NOW PEOPLE ARE WALKING INTO MALLS IN MINNESOTA SCREAMING 'ALLAH AHKBAR' AS THEY STAB MY FELLOW AMERICANS.So, beside that what do we have?

He used to hangout at Studio 54 in the coke and gay days. He knew Andy Warhol. Guy is middle of the road.

I have been a longtime lurker on this board but this is my first time posting. I have many questions that I'm hoping someone can help me with since you all seem to be very knowledgeable in this area..In terms of nuclear weapons I know we have tested over 1000 and I know the radiation has increased cases of cancer and killed livestock but shouldn't there be more of an impact? I know the theory with nuclear war ending life as we know it derives from the fact that it would cause a nuclear winter there for beginning some sort of ice age on earth.. with all the weapons that have been tested should we not have already brought ourselves to this or does it more have to do with all weapons going off all at once? Another question being I heard that radiation dissipates quickly (with the most dangerous time being the first 48 hours) if so then how would it cause a nuclear winter? I know these are silly questions I am pretty bad with science so I am hoping someone can explain better.Another question.. I am very sure this article has been linked here before but wondering if someone can give me their thoughts and either disprove the article or explain why it's true. [ link to heiwaco.tripod.com ] Personally I find it's safer to believe they work, if a crazy person threatens you saying they have a gun you take it for face value. You don't want to question them about it or dare them to prove it!In terms of world 3... have all biblical prophecies been fulfilled already to believe world war 3 is next on the timeline? I would be lying if I said I'm not scared. When it comes to death. .it sucks sure but I'm not afraid for myself.. I'm afraid for my one year old! I will do ANYTHING to protect her even if it means giving up my life so she can have a beautiful, healthy, long life! I do believe in God and I find myself turning a lot to him these last few days but I can't help but be angry and feel so guilty bringing this beautiful soul into this world.. for what? So she can suffer and die before she even turns 3? I just feel so lost and hurt. If anyone can give me advice or guidance I would appreciate it more than you know.

Those little high tech weenies bug me. And I'm a techie!!! The rumored second round of layoffs at Twitter – which in 2011 was granted by the befuddled city of San Francisco the “Twitter tax break” on employment taxes – comes at a very inopportune moment for the glory of commercial real estate. These layoffs would amount to 8% to Twitter’s workforce, or about 300 people, according to Bloomberg.Already, Twitter has thrown 183,642 square feet of vacant office space at its two-building Mid-Market headquarters on the sublease market, thus bringing it to 1.51 million square feet (msf).This comes at a time when, according to the “snapshot” from Cushman & Wakefield, leasing activity nearly ground to a halt in the third quarter, with only 875,000 sf leased – the lowest since 2001!There was only one major lease deal over 100,000 sf: Amazon’s live streaming video platform Twitch, which took 178,000 sf. The next largest deal was less than half that size: WeWork leased 78,000 sf.Leasing activity for the three quarters this year plunged 30% from the same period last year, to just 4.7 msf, according to a report released this week by commercial real estate services firm Savills Studley, which added dryly, “The competition for space has calmed dramatically from several quarters ago.”And there is a lot of new supply coming on the market, according to Cushman & Wakefield: currently, 3.8 msf of office space are under construction, with 31% preleased.Overall vacancy rose 0.7 percentage points from the prior quarter to 9.0% in Q3, according to Savills Studley. In Class A buildings, availability jumped 1.1 percentage points to 10.4%. Some areas were still red-hot, but others are turning cold: In the SOMA area, there were practically no vacancies (1.0%). But at the other end of the spectrum, vacancies at the Financial District South spiked 2.5 percentage points to 12.3%.way more at [ link to wolfstreet.com ] ""My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance."" 1 Previous Page",english,2016-10-26T21:22:16.351+03:00,godlikeproductions.com,US,12387,Tech” Malaise Pricks San Francisco Office Space Bubble,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Donald Trump is going to be the next president &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#65533;&#655​33;&#65533; at least according to one pretty accurate election model.This assertion isn't a surprise. In February, the model's creator, Helmut Norpoth, gave Trump a 97 percent chance of becoming No. 45 if he got the GOP nomination, though the model now gives Trump an 87 percent chance.Norpoth's model predicts general election results based on how the candidate does in his or her party's primary. Norpoth applied the model to past elections and says it worked for every presidential election except one since 1912.""My feeling always has been, what I saw in the primaries, was that Donald Trump did very well,"" Norpoth said. ""He beat a large field. According to my metric about how primaries are shaping up, he did better than Hillary Clinton in the Democratic race, so that gave him a leg up.""There are a couple of issues with this. Usually, candidates shift their message after the primary to appeal to voters outside their base. Trump isn't doing that. His speeches haven't changed much, if at all, and he's not really bringing anyone new into his tent.Also, the model doesn't factor in anything that's actually happening in the country at the time. And factors like the economy, the incumbent president's approval numbers and the country's demographics all affect how people cast their vote in November.Outside of Norpoth's model, basically every other measurement out there shows Donald Trump's chance of winning 270 electoral votes is super slim. But, hey, this is 2016, and if we've learned anything, it's that there is nothing normal about this election cycle.

I don’t see humanity as any better or worse than any other species and if I were to attribute ""genius"" to anything it would be to the spirit that binds with the human body. I don’t think she took it that way but her response was emotive as it was, no point in adding to it. She feels how she feels, I do how I do. An argument changes neither of our views and how we act in real life. Hence adding about practicality and empirical occurrence. If things don’t change in real life, I don’t see the point in arguing. 11:32 PM; out and about 11:34 PM: there is a value in exchanging ideas even if you don’t mutually change your original opinion, it offers perspective 11:34 PM; I’ve been over that same notion with others before, I lean away from that 12:16 AM: why? 12:16 AM; start with why not? 12:17 AM: didn’t I just say my opinion though? that would be my reason 12:17 AM; for me, cost benefit analysis is usually such that discussions carry more risk than potential benefit 12:18 AM: see, I don’t feel that way at all. I feel exactly the opposite. I always feel that if you are open to learning about others, there’s never a wasted discussion 12:19 AM; one can’t give equal weight to all relationships, one can’t be open to everyone yet give whole focus on who counts most in their life 12:21 AM: well, yeah you prioritize the people who count the most to you, but that doesn’t have to exclude others you talk to either 12:21 AM; I mean things quite more broadly, taken in principle and in turn down to the minute. If I spent so much time engaging in random discussions with random people I’d hardly have the time and energy for discussions and people that are not so random to my life, let alone those not random at all. 12:23 AM: I disagree. I think there is plenty of time for discussions with random strangers and important people. We spend a lot of time online anyway, we might as well make the time we do spend meaningful. Plenty just browse social media or don’t interact at all. We may be strangers but we are a real social circle. It may be far less important then the face to face interactions for you, but is there no time for it and is it meaningless? IMO no. 12:28 AM; You misunderstand. Before I speak for myself more, take a look at the fueds of the people you know. You can’t choose equanimity for all of them even if you wanted to. 12:31 AM: sure, but that doesn’t mean those people don’t mean anything to me, or that I’d write them off 12:32 AM; It’s not about that, especially if you’re focusing on discussion/interaction in this case. If anything to opt out represents greater sense of caring for others. 12:33 AM: how? 12:33 AM; by sparing people hardship through disagreement for one 12:34 AM: disagreement is enlightening. as sun tzu says, those we disagree with often teach as the most. I think it’s important to understand the perspective of others. it’s not a hardship, discussion and disagreement is how the truth is found. if you avoid those who disagree with you you easily fall prey to a cognitive fallacy known as confirmation bias 12:35 AM; note I said cost benefit analysis before. the risks comes too great and people get heated and even friendships break. I say that from observation including of your own friends, and I say that from experience regarding mine. I spared ___ an argument just now that wouldn’t have changed her view on anything if it happened, nor would it have changed mine. It’s the same now, I won’t change your view and you won’t change mine. 12:37 AM: well that’s silly imo ___. I think intellectual peers need to learn how to dissociate their ideas from their feelings and friendships and the people in this room are more then capable of that. are you? 12:38 AM Page 1",english,2016-10-26T22:41:38.926+03:00,godlikeproductions.com,US,12387,The nonsense she says,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

The whole creation waits, mankind waits, for this ""REAL"" church to be revealed...Even God waits, for this real church being exposed to the physical churches, and to mankind.

It was after the birth and resurrection of Jesus. So it's talking about the future.Being that a woman is pregnant for 9 months, and the birth takes place in September 2017 what will we see.Surly this child born will be mature, it won't have to grow for 33 yrs, that is why it is called the man-child...It is also the body of Christ, but plural, meaning MANY.It is not singular, as when Jesus came the first time, and that one singular body died on the cross.

Earlier this year, WikiLeaks released emails showing that the Democratic National Committee had maliciously conspired to undermine the presidential campaign of Clinton challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders, in order to elevate Hillary Clinton to the top of the ticket. 
Now it has emerged that two of the top lawyers representing Assange, John Jones in London and Michael Ratner in New York, died within less than a month of each other this year. And, Assange’s closest confidant in London and a Director of WikiLeaks, Gavin Macfadyen, died just yesterday. 
Wall Street On Parade has carefully investigated the similarly unprecedented banker deaths over the past two and one half years. What is noteworthy about the banker deaths is that at the time of the deaths, Wall Street banks and their global brethren were under the largest investigations for criminal rigging of markets to occur in the past century. Even during the Senate investigations of the early 1930s when crooked business journalists touting fraudulent Wall Street stocks and crooked Wall Street bank execs manipulating stock prices were regularly revealed through subpoenaed documents, there was no similar rash of deaths or series of alleged suicides. (See related articles below.) 
Now there is WikiLeaks leaking emails and documents that show that the same kind of cartel-like behavior that has corrupted Wall Street to its core has also infested the top of the Democratic Party. And, amazingly, three key members of the Assange/WikiLeaks support network have died within six months of each other this year. The statistical probability of this being a natural occurrence is slim.

[10/26/16] ADAN SALAZAR – A county in Texas has switched to “emergency paper ballots” after electronic voting machines in the region suffered technical glitches. 
Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne issued a press release Tuesday night announcing electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected. 

“The Straight Party vote for both the Republicans and Democrats did not automatically select one race on each ballot,” states the press release. 
“The error was caused in programming by ES&S (Election Systems and Software Inc.), the vendor who programs the election software used in Chambers County.” 
“The Straight Party vote for both the Republicans and Democrats did not automatically select one race on each ballot,” states the press release. 
“The error was caused in programming by ES&S (Election Systems and Software Inc.), the vendor who programs the election software used in Chambers County.” 
“Immediately, Hawthorne contacted ES&S and advised them of the issue. Hawthorne then contacted the Secretary of State’s office, the office overseeing the elections in Texas, and was informed to create emergency paper ballots to be used until the problem could be fixed.” 
Hawthorne claims she discovered the problem Monday morning after she cast her own vote and reviewed the electronic ballot. 
“Moving temporarily to paper ballots in such a situation is standard protocol,” Hawthorne reportedly told 12NewsNow . 
On Wednesday, Hawthorne issued another press release claiming the machines had been fixed. 
“Using paper ballots in the interim, as prescribed by the Texas Election Code, allowed our vendor to resolve the issue quickly,” she wrote. 
Elsewhere in Texas , in towns such as Arlington and Amarillo, other voters have reported witnessing their votes flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. 
Election officials in those places, however, blamed users for the errors. 
Earlier in the week, Infowars attempted to speak with the Texas Director of Elections Keith Ingram about public concerns over possible voter fraud, but he didn’t want to talk to us.

[10/26/16] VICKI BATTS – Just one month ago, a California judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit that seeks to challenge the USDA on their recent, unlawful changes to how synthetic substances are evaluated in the production of organic goods. 
While the charges are simply “alleged” for now, more than a dozen organizations came forward to press the issue. They discovered that at least 20 substances that would have been banned under the previous evaluation method had been allowed to slide through and into our organic foods . 
Unsurprisingly, the federal agency requested that the case be dismissed because they believe that these organizations do not have the legal standing to press such a lawsuit. Our founding fathers probably rolled in their graves when the USDA suggested that any of the citizens of the country for which it serves did not have the “legal standing” to challenge them in court, but particularly those who may be be harmed by its doings. 
Fortunately, U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam Jr. of San Francisco disagreed with the USDA’s sentiments, and is allowing the litigation to move forward. Capital Press reports, “Gilliam ruled that it’s plausible the plaintiffs will be harmed by the USDA’s policy change, which they say has allowed more than 20 synthetic substances to continue being used in organic agriculture.” 
The organizations came together to voice their concerns (and press charges) last year, arguing that the agency’s changes to their procedures for handling synthetic substances in organics have effectively made it much more difficult to remove a synthetic ingredient from the list of approved substances. In other words, these new regulations are making it harder to keep organic food clean. 
The organizations’ concerns are primarily focused on the USDA’s decision in 2013 to change the five-year “sunset process” for synthetics that are approved for organic farming. In the past, synthetic substances were banned from the list, unless two-thirds of the 15-member National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) agreed that they should be permitted to remain on the list. 
The USDA has taken this policy and flipped it on its head; in order to eliminate a synthetic chemical from the list, now the NOSB must obtain a vote of at least two-thirds. So instead of voting for a chemical to remain on the list, the NOSB now has to vote to remove them. This means that even a majority of nine people will not be able to effectively remove unwanted substances from organic foods. 
Will Fantle, co-founder of the Cornucopia Institute, a nonprofit organic industry watchdog site, commented, “This gets at the heart of decision-making at the National Organic Standards Board.” Fantle also noted that now, instead of allowing these products to “sunset,” or simply fade out of use, the USDA’s new policy will force these ingredients into the “land of the midnight sun.” 
The plaintiffs state that the USDA’s newly-minted process harms consumers who pay a premium for organic produce and products, because there is an expectation that these goods are produced with a minimal amount of synthetics. This deception also harms farmers, because it undermines the “organic” label. These are products that are supposed to be produced with integrity in mind. 
The first lawsuit presented by the group was dismissed because it lacked specificity. Not to be deterred, the plaintiffs identified 20 different substances that would have been banned under the previous NOSB policy. In their lawsuit, they also state that “ the USDA promulgated the regulation without providing the public the opportunity for notice and comment and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner[.]” 
Hopefully, the lawsuit will be successful and the USDA will be forced to revoke their terrible new policy. If Americans continue to band together and fight against such deceitful practices, we may eventually be able to clean up our food (and our country).

[10/26/16] J.D.HEYES – Only the sickest, most warped and ideologically polluted minds would secretly hope for greater death and destruction to their own people and country, but such is the case with “climate change” zealots . 
As pointed out by Investor’s Business Daily (IBD), it was former President Obama crony and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel who once infamously remarked that political leaders should never let serious crises “go to waste,” because they can use them to advance a political agenda where they could not do so before. 
As for the recent Hurricane Matthew, it appears as though a number of political operatives and true believers in the global warming religion likely wanted it to be worse than it actually was (which, to many people, was bad enough). 
Why? Because that would be consistent with their history. 
For the record, the storm killed 30 Americans and more than 1,000 people in total. Early damage estimates were put at about $5 billion. Yet that is not enough death and destruction for the global warming hoaxers. 
For the record, the hoaxers have tried advancing the narrative that in this day and age, thanks to man-caused actions, the weather is getting worse and more severe . Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton enlisted the assistance of the hoaxer-in-chief, Al Gore, her husband’s vice president and today’s chief global warming liar, to use Matthew to advance the phony narrative. 
Only, before the hurricane actually made landfall days ago in South Carolina, it had been more than 4,000 days since a hurricane actually struck the United States. That’s 10 years, 11 months and some change. 
Alarmists were “itching for a large-scale disaster,” IBD reported, because every day that passed that didn’t herald a major weather event, especially one on an epic scale, meant that their dire predictions of more and bigger storms made them look like clueless, silly con artists (which they are). 
Their sick impatience for a major weather-related crisis was summarized very well a couple of years ago when a guy named Greg Blanchette announced that since the weather is getting worse and more severe , that he “kind of” hoped that North America “gets it’s a** kicked this hurricane season. It would motivate us on climate action.” 
Like we said, sick . 
This may or may not be the same Greg Blanchette who advocated placing scary global warming warnings on gasoline pumps – which is now law in North Vancouver, British Columbia. That doesn’t matter, though, because if it’s not the same person, that only means there are two global warming hoaxer cranks out there sharing the same name. 
Then, as IBD noted, a couple of years before this Blanchette dude was hoping for weather-related death and destruction, British naturalist David Attenborough noted that a “disaster” was required to wake people up to the massive threat of climate change. 
Up to that point, the “disasters” that the U.S. had experienced “with hurricanes and floods … [didn’t] do it.” So, a cataclysmic event was needed in order to scare enough people into demanding some sort of action, which of course would come in the form of costly government regulations that are not based on sound, demonstrable and replicable scientific data. 
Then, as Matthew tore up Florida’s Atlantic Coast, Marshall Shepherd, an atmospheric sciences professor at the University of Georgia, outed the sick hoaxers , tweeting that he was hearing “ridiculous complaining” that the hurricane was actually less powerful than anticipated. 
“Some seem disappointed there isn’t tragic loss of life/apocalyptic,” he noted, adding: “I am thankful.” 
IBD summed up the facts: While the environmental movement contains sincere people, it is also replete with idiots and lunatics who yearn for a planet devoid of humans (with the exception of themselves, of course). Attenborough himself has complained to the British press that human beings are a “plague on the Earth.” (We assume he is counting himself as well, which – if he is – seems even less rational, if that’s possible.) 
There are nothing but theories claiming that man-caused activity is responsible for changing weather patterns. There is no hard evidence and there is no replicable data, which there should be if such claims were provable outside of anecdotal findings . If this was a real issue the language would not have changed from “global cooling” in the 1970s, to “global warming” in the 1980s and ’90s, to “climate change” today.

[10/26/16] J.D. HEYES- More Americans might be accepting of President Barack Obama’s zealous push to flood the country with refugees from war-torn parts of the world, if only he, along with federal and state officials, were more transparent about the entire process. 
Like for instance being up front with Americans about the health threat posed by many of these refugees. 
Breitbart News is reporting that officials at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, county health departments throughout the state and local offices of refugee resettlement agencies – all of whom are working closely with the Obama administration – have taken to hiding the latent tuberculosis infection rates among refugees from the general public. 
The website noted further that the “culture of concealment” in Michigan contrasts with how several other states deal with latent TB infection rates among refugees. 
As Breitbart News has reported in the past , the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services doesn’t collect latent TB infection rate information from county health departments or local resettlement agencies it hires to perform initial medical screenings of newly-arrived refugees. Also, the state agency obviously does not honor its legal obligation to do so under provisions of the Refugee Act of 1980. Michigan officials not keeping TB data required by law 
When the news service asked MDHHS officials for data about latent TB infection rates based on the full population of refugees screened, a spokesman for the agency, Bob Wheaton, said, “We do not have that data.” 
Breitbart noted that the agency has hired a number of county health departments, and in some counties private refugee health screening services, all working in cooperation with local resettlement officials for the purpose of conducting initial medical screenings of all new refugee arrivals. 
Under guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and MDHHS, all refugees who complete initial health screenings are tested for latent TB infection. However, MDHHS officials said that neither the counties nor private agencies are sharing screening data. What’s more, the counties and private refugee health screeners who do have the TB data will not make that information available to the public. 
As Breitbart News noted further: 
“In the case of at least one private refugee health screening service, the Arab American and Chaldean Council, which MDHHS has hired to conduct refugee health screenings in Wayne County, Macomb County, and Oakland County, that data is also not being shared with health departments in those counties.” 
Again, the provision of the data is a requirement of federal statutes regarding the health screening status of refugees. One-third of the rest of the world has latent TB 
Many states have made this information public in annual reports. They include Minnesota, where the latent TB infection rate among newly-arrived refugees in 2014 was 22 percent; Indiana (26 percent); Arizona (18 percent); Utah (18 percent), Texas (15 percent); California (12 percent) and Florida (12 percent). 
In addition, Breitbart News noted, other states made information available to the news service after repeated requests. They include Tennessee (27 percent); Vermont (35 percent); and Idaho (21 percent). 
It is vital to identify refugees coming into the United States with latent TB infections, because treatment must begin immediately in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Also, studies – including one from the University of California, San Diego in 2013 – have shown that higher rates of latent TB infection among resettled refugees pose a greater health risk to the general public in regions where they have been sent. 
Latent TB turns into a public health risk when it activates into infectious TB, a process that is generally associated with lower levels of immunity among those with latent TB. In the U.S., 4 percent of the general population has latent TB; 10 percent of those develop active TB at some point during their lives. 
By contrast, fully one-third – 33 percent – of the rest of the world has latent TB, Breitbart News reported.

It is an exploration of life and the hope than drives it. Curtain says in the following piece: “The news of one creative spirit’s death gave birth to another creative spirit’s gift to life.” And a recognition of the creative contribution of one has inspired an examination of creativity itself. “The song ‘Political World’ could have been triggered by current events. There was a heated presidential race underway …. But I had no interest in politics as an art form….The political world in the song is more of an underworld….With the song I thought I might have broken through to something. It was like you wake up from a deep and drugged slumber and somebody strikes a little silver gong and you come to your senses.” Bob Dylan, Chronicles W e live in dark times when the prison gates of seeming hopelessness clang shut around us. Endless U.S. led and sponsored wars, a New Cold War, nuclear threats, economic exploitation, oligarchical rule, government spying, drone killings, loss of civil liberties, terrorism, ecological degradation, etc. – the list is long and depressing. Awareness of a deep state hidden behind the marionette theatre of conventional politics has grown, even as the puppet show of electoral distractions garners the headlines. Readers of the alternative media learn the truth of government conspiracies involving assassinations – JFK, MLK, RFK, et al. – and countless other evil deeds without cessation. Excellent writers uncover and analyze the machinations of those responsible. Anger and frustration mount as people listen to a litany of bad news and propaganda spewed out by the mainstream corporate media. It is easy to be overwhelmed and disheartened. Despite the mute despair and apathy that fill the air, hope is needed to carry on and resist these destructive forces. Sometimes in such a dark time the eye begins to see and the ear hears hope in unexpected places. Doing so necessitates a bit of a sideways move to discover pockets of resistance hiding in the shadows. There are torches of illumination in the underworld, but we need to come to our senses to get there. “Emotion is the chief source of all becoming-conscious. There can be no transforming of darkness into light and of apathy into movement without emotion.” Carl Jung If you’ve ever played music or basketball, fell dizzyingly in love, or lapsed into a spell writing words or being engrossed in a passionate pursuit, you’ll easily grasp what follows. But maybe these specific experiences aren’t necessary. You’ve lived, you’re alive, and you can hear the pitter-patter beat of your dribbling heart. That’s probably plenty. You know the game can be a roller-coaster ride with all its ups and downs, and when it ends you will have won or lost something, exactly what being of the essence. Rhythm, melody, and movement: from these life is born and sustained. They are also integral to sports and art – music, writing, painting, sculpture, dance, etc. – even when they are apparently absent. Tall Walking Figure by Alberto Giacometti. (Credit: Billy Liar .) If, for example, one looks at Alberto Giacometti’s sculpture, Tall Walking Figure, its immobility implies movement. Such paradoxical inclusiveness pertains to still-life painting as well. While seemingly immobile, and defined by some as dead life, such paintings are encompassed by the presence of the absence of movement and change, the essence of all living things. To grasp the paradoxical nature of art – and life – one must approach them as an artist and see the wholeness in broken pieces. “Everything is broken,” Bob Dylan sings, “take a deep breath, feel like you’re choking.” “Life is the best play of all.” Sophie Michel, a 7 year-old musician I think it is fair to say that living is the ultimate art and as the artists of our lives our medium is time and space. And that it is in sound that time and space are epitomized. Musical sounds carry us through time and space in a reverberating vital impulse. Music brings us to our senses. Being emotional, it sets us in motion. We are moved. Sports, as the etymology of the word suggests (desporter – to divert), is a diversion from something. Sports involve us in movement through time and space to an unnecessary goal where someone wins and someone losses. In sports we choose to overcome superfluous obstacles for fun and for deeper reasons we may not realize. Sports only matter because they don’t. “What we play is life.” Louis Armstrong A few years ago my friends and I were playing in basketball tournaments for men over fifty and we qualified for the Senior Olympics at the University of Pittsburgh. We acquired a sponsor, a local funeral home that made warm-up jerseys for us. Being used to dealing with bodies at rest, these comedians knew we were a bunch of aging hoopsters intent on keeping our bodies in motion for as long as we could. So they had shirts made with that up-beat and adolescent cliché printed on the front, “Basketball is Life.” Lest we forgot, and being in the trade of taking bodies at rest to the underworld, on the back they had printed “Leave the Rest to Us: Flynn and Dagnoli Funeral Home.” Most of us found the juxtaposition hilarious (including one funny Irishman who ended up dead at the funeral home), but one teammate found it disturbing, which gave the rest of us additional sardonic laughs. Sex and death and one’s ongoing vitality are the stuff of uneasy laughter in the locker rooms of aging men. It’s a place for essentials. “He was like a great singer with a style all his own, a pacing that was different, a flair for the unusual.” Chick Hearn, play-by-play announcer for The Los Angeles Lakers about Pete Maravich I was reminded of this as I was rereading bits of Bob Dylan’s fascinating and poetic memoir, Chronicles: Volume I, and came upon his recounting of hearing of the news of the death of “Pistol” Pete Maravich, the greatest scorer in college basketball history and a magician without par on the court. It was January 5, 1988. 
My aunt was in the kitchen and I sat down with her to talk and drink coffee. The radio was playing and morn- ing news was on. I was startled to hear that Pete Maravich, the basketball player, had collapsed on a basketball court in Pasadena, just fell over and never got up. I’d seen Maravich play in New Orleans once, when the Utah Jazz were the New Orleans Jazz. He was something to see – mop of brown hair, floppy socks – the holy terror of the basketball world – high flyin’ – magician of the court. The night I saw him he dribbled the ball with his head, scored a behind the back, no look basket – dribbled the length of the court, threw the ball up off the glass and caught his own pass. He was fantastic. Scored something like thirty-eight points. He could have played blind. Pistol Pete hadn’t played professionally for a while, and he was thought of as forgotten. I hadn’t forgotten about him, though. Some people seem to fade away but then when they are truly gone, it’s like they didn’t fade away at all. Dylan has the poet’s touch, of course, a hyperbolic sense of the fantastic that draws you into his magical web in the pursuit of deeper truth. In ways he’s like the Latin American magical realist writers who move from fact to dream to the fantastic in a puff of wind. He goes on to write that after hearing the news of Pistol Pete’s sad death playing pickup basketball, he started and completed the song “Dignity” the same day, and in the days that followed song after song flowed from his pen. The news of one creative spirit’s death gave birth to another creative spirit’s gift to life. (I am reminded of Shakespeare writing Hamlet after his father’s death.) “It’s like I saw the song up in front of me and overtook it, like I saw all the characters in this song and elected to cast my fortunes with them …. The wind could never blow it out of my head. This song was a good thing to have. On a song like this, there’s no end to things.” One can hear echoes of Hemingway, another artist obsessed with death, in those last few sentences. Unlike Hemingway, however, Dylan’s focus on death is in the service of life and hope. For him there is no end, while Hemingway is all ending – nada, nada, nada – nothing, nothing, nothing – “it was all a nothing and a man was nothing too,” he writes in his haunting story, “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.” Dylan’s focus on the shadow of death is seen within the light of life – todo – all or everything. The darkness is there but is encompassed by the light. Nada within todo. As he told the AARP magazine last year in a fascinating interview, he’s been singing about death since he’s been twelve. And out of that singing – year after year for fifty plus years and counting – he has found and expressed the light of hope. Bob Dylan (Credit: Moderate Voice ) Dylan is our Emerson. His artistic philosophy has always been about movement in space and time through song. Always moving, always restless, always seeking a way back home through song, even when, or perhaps because, there are no directions. “An artist has got to be careful never to arrive at a place where he thinks he’s at somewhere,” he’s said. “You always have to realize that you are constantly in a state of becoming and as long as you can stay in that realm you’ll be alright.” Sounds like living, right. Sounds like Emerson, also. “Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. Thus one fact the world hates, that the soul becomes.” It was about ten years ago when we traveled to that Senior Basketball Olympics at the University of Pittsburgh. We drew many uneasy smiles as we paraded around with the backs of our shirts announcing the services of the men who take us to the underworld. We won a few games and lost others; were eliminated and left for home disappointed, some of us more than others, depending on each man’s competitive fire to defeat the foe. Like all athletes, losing felt like a small death. Even small deaths are hard to swallow, however, especially when knowing how way leads on to way and you doubt you will ever come back. As evening was darkening the Amish countryside, we departed east through country roads in silence, each lost in his interior monologue on the journey ahead. Playing low on the radio, from my back seat I could barely make out Dylan singing, “It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there.” Two years ago there was a short Grantland documentary, “The Finish Line,” about Steve Nash, the latest Pistol Pete. An uncanny player, Nash was battling injuries and age, and the documentary shows him pondering whether or not to retire or continue his rehabilitation and attempt a comeback. In the opening scene Nash goes out with his dog into the shadowy pre-dawn where he muses on his dilemma. His words are hypnotic. “I feel,” he said, “that there’s something that I can’t quite put my finger on that – I don’t know – I feel that it’s blocking me or I can see it out of the corner of my mind’s eye, or it’s like this dark presence ….is it the truth that I’m done?” Hobbled by a nerve injury that severely limited his movement, he played a few more games and retired within a year. Like Pete Maravich, he had brought an infectious joy to his playing, but he left without fulfilling his dream of winning an NBA championship. Of his retirement he said, “It’s bittersweet. I already miss the game deeply, but I’m also really excited to learn to do something else.” Unlike many athletes, Nash was moving on; his “dark presence” wasn’t a final death but a step on the road to a hard rebirth. It was a Dylanesque restless farewell: “And though the line is cut/It ain’t quite the end/I‘ll just bid farewell till we meet again.” “A song is like a dream, and you try to make it come true. They’re like strange countries that you have to enter. You can write a song anywhere …. It helps to be moving. Sometimes people who have the greatest talent for writing songs never write any because they are not moving.” Bob Dylan, Chronicles Dylan has long been accused of abandoning his youthful idealism and protest music. I think this is a bum rap. He was never a protester, though his songs became anthems of the civil rights and anti-war movements. There is no doubt that those songs were inspirational and gave people hope to carry on the good fight. But in turning in a more oblique and circumspect musical direction, following his need to change as the spirit of inspiration moved him, Dylan’s songs have come to inspire in a new way. You know his sympathies lie with the oppressed and downtrodden, but he doesn’t shout it. A listener has to catch his drift. If you go to the music, and dip into his various stylistic changes over the decades, you will find a consistency of themes. He deals with essentials like all great poets. Nothing is excluded. His work is paradoxical. Yes, he’s been singing about death since twelve, but it has always been countered by life and rebirth. There is joy and sadness; faith and doubt; happiness and suffering; injustice and justice; romance and its discontents; despair and hope. His music possesses a bit of a Taoist quality mixed with a Biblical sensibility conveyed by a hopelessly romantic American. He has fused his themes into an incantatory delivery that casts a moving spell of hope upon the listener. He is nothing if not a spiritual spell-binder; similar in many ways to that other quintessential American – the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, whose best work was a poetic quest for an inspired salvific poetry. If the listener is expecting an argument, a thesis, inductive reasoning, or a didactic approach from Dylan, he is out of luck, and rather than be inspired he will be disappointed. This is art, not theory, and art of a special kind since Dylan is an artist at war with his art. His songs demand that the listener’s mind and spirit be moving as the spirit of creative inspiration moved Dylan. A close listening will force one to jump from verse to verse – to shoot the gulf – since there are no bridges to cross, no connecting links. The sound carries you over and keeps you moving forward. If you’re not moving, you’ll miss the meaning. “A bird does not sing because it has an answer. It sings because it has a song.” Chinese Proverb So if the world is getting you down and all the news is bad to your ears, don’t lose hope. Step to the side, out of the glare of the sun, the blare of the headlines where lies and fears shout in our ears and echo down our days like a repetitive nightmare. Give Dylan a listen. As he has said of spiritual songs, “They brought me down to earth and they lifted me up all in the same moment.” His songs have the same paradoxical power because he excludes nothing. That is why they are truthful. It is fitting that his latest album, “Shadows in the Night,” comprised of ten beloved old ballads sung by Frank Sinatra, from “The Night We Called it a Day” to “Some Enchanted Evening,” has him changing again, going back to go forward. He is full of surprises, which any child will tell you bring joy because surprises and change are the core of living. To change this crazed world, we must change and find hope and joy along the way. Repetition will kill us. Dylan’s artistic metamorphoses and ingenious song writing offer offbeat sources of hope. Just listen. Having been compared to Frank Sinatra with these songs, he’s said, “You must be joking. To be mentioned in the same breath as him must be some sort of high compliment. As far as touching him goes, nobody touches him. Not me or anyone else …. But he never went away. All those things we thought were here to stay, they did go away. But he never did.” Sinatra, like Pistol Pete, didn’t fade away because he too inspired Dylan to inspire us to hope and carry on. If it feels dark and night-like to you, move sideways into the shadows. Look away and you’ll see the light. Or if you like basketball or dancing, like to move to the beat, listen to Dylan singing “Hurricane,” a long narrative song about the framing of the boxer Ruben “Hurricane” Carter. It will get your blood flowing, your passions riled, and your body moving. It’s perfect for practicing all the dribbling tricks Pistol Pete performed. I thought of using it at the Senior Olympics, but the beat seemed a little too rapid and excitable for the over fifty AARP crowd. The shirts were sending an undertaking message that I didn’t want made real. Hope is one thing, but traveling too fast is another. Anyway, one of my teammates was in swift pursuit of a woman there whom he described as a twin of his ideal woman – Pamela Anderson. He didn’t need any more excitement.

And talk about choosing his venue with aplomb; right in the heart of the Rising Dragon, no less. 
Capping his state visit to Beijing, Duterte then coined the mantra – pregnant with overtones – that will keep ringing all across the global South; “America has lost.” 
And if that was not enough, he announced a new alliance – Philippines, China and Russia – is about to emerge; “there are three of us against the world.” 
Predictably, the Beltway establishment in the “indispensable nation” went bananas, reacting as “puzzled” or in outright anger, dispersing the usual expletives on the “crude populist”, “unhinged leader”. 
The bottom line is that it takes a lot of balls for the leader of a poor, developing country, in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, to openly defy the hyperpower. Yet what Duterte is gaming at is pure realpolitik; if he prevails, he will be able to deftly play the US against China to the benefit of Filipino interests. 
“The springtime of our relationship” 
It did start with a bang; during Duterte’s China visit, Manila inked no less than $13 billion in deals with Beijing – from trade and investment to drug control, maritime security and infrastructure. 
Beijing pulled out all stops to make Duterte feel welcomed. 
President Xi Jinping suggested Manila and Beijing should “temporarily put aside” the intractable South China Sea disputes and learn from the “political wisdom” of history – as in give space to diplomatic talks. After all, the two peoples were “blood-linked brothers.” 
Duterte replied in kind; “Even as we arrive in Beijing close to winter, this is the springtime of our relationship,” he told Xi at the Great Hall of the People. 
China is already the Philippines’ second-largest trade partner, behind Japan, the US and Singapore. Filipino exports to these three are at roughly 42.7 percent of the total, compared to 22.1 to China/Hong Kong. Imports from China are roughly 16.1 percent of the total. Even as trade with China is bound to rise, what really matters for Duterte is massive Chinese infrastructure investment. 
What this will mean in practice is indeed ground-breaking; the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) will definitely be involved in Philippine economic development; Manila will be more involved in promoting smooth China-ASEAN relations in all sorts of regional issues (it takes the rotating chair of ASEAN in 2017); and the Philippines will be more integrated in the New Silk Roads, a.k.a. One Belt, One Road (OBOR). 
Three strikes; no wonder the US is out. And there’s even a fourth strike, embedded in Duterte’s promise that he will soon end military cooperation with the US, despite the opposition of part of the Filipino armed forces. 
Watch the First Island Chain 
The build-up had already been dramatic enough. On the eve of his meeting with Xi, talking to members of the Filipino community in Beijing, Duterte said, “it’s time to say goodbye” to the US; “I will not ask but if they (the Chinese) offer and if they’ll ask me, do you need this aid? [I will say] Of course, we are very poor.” 
Then the clincher; “I will not go to America anymore … We will just be insulted there.” Naval Base Subic Bay was a major ship-repair, supply, and rest and recreation facility of the Spanish Navy and subsequently the United States Navy located in Olongapo, Zambales, Philippines. The base was 262 square miles, about the size of Singapore. It was finally turned over to the Filipino government in 1992. 
The US was the colonial power in the Philippines from 1899 to 1942. Hollywood permeates the collective unconscious. English is the lingua franca – side by side with tagalog. But the tentacles of Uncle Sam’s “protection” racket are not exactly welcomed. Two of the largest components of the US Empire of Bases were located for decades in the Philippines; Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base. 
Clark, occupying 230 square miles, with 15,000 people, was busy to death during the Vietnam War – the main hub for men and hardware in and out of Saigon. Then it turned into one of those Pentagon “forward operating” HQs. Subic, occupying 260 square miles, was as busy as Clark. It was the forward operating base for the US 7th Fleet. 
Already in 1987, before the end of the Cold War, the RAND corporation was alarmed by the loss of both bases; that would be “devastating for regional security”. Devastating” in the – mythical – sense of “defending the interests of ASEAN” and the “security of the sea-lanes”. 
Translation; the Pentagon and the US Navy would lose a key instrument of pressure over ASEAN, as protecting the “security of the sea-lanes” was always the key justification for those bases. 
And lose they eventually did; Clark was closed down in November 1991, and Subic in November 1992. 
It took years for China to sense an opening – and profit from it; after all during the 1990s and the early 2000s, the absolute priority was breakneck speed internal development. But then Beijing did the math; no more US bases opened untold vistas as far as the First Island Chain is concerned. 
The First Island Chain is a product, over millennia, of the fabulous tectonic forces of the Ring of Fire; a chain of islands running from southern Japan in the north to Borneo in the south. For Beijing, they work as a sort of shield for the Chinese eastern seaboard; if this chain is secure, Asia is secure. 
For all practical purposes, Beijing considers the First Island Chain as a non-negotiable Western Pacific demarcation zone – ideally with no foreign (as in US) interference. The South China Sea – which in parts is characterized by Manila as the Western Philippine Sea – is inside the First Island Chain. So to really secure the First Island Chain, the South China Sea must be free of foreign interference. 
And here we are plunged at the heart of arguably the key 21st century hotspot in Asian geopolitics – the main reason for the Obama administration’s pivot to Asia. 
The US Navy so far counted on the Philippines to oppose the proverbial, hyped up “Chinese aggression” in the South China and East China seas. The neocon/neoliberalcon industrial-military complex fury against “unhinged” Duterte’s game-changer is that containing China and ruling over the First Island Chain has been at the core of US naval strategy since the beginning of the Cold War. 
Beijing, meanwhile, will have all the time needed to polish its strategic environment. This has nothing to do with “freedom of navigation” and protecting sea-lanes; everyone needs South China Sea cross-trade. It’s all about China – perhaps within the next ten years – being able to deny “access” to the US Navy in the South China Sea and inside the First Island Chain. 
Duterte’s game-changing “America has lost” is just a new salvo in arguably the key 21st century geopolitical thriller. A Supreme Court justice in Manila, for instance, has warned Duterte that, were he to give up sovereignty over the Scarborough Shoal, he could be impeached. That won’t happen; Duterte wants loads of Chinese trade and investment, not abdicate from sovereignty. He’d rather be ready to confront being demonized by the hyperpower as much as the late Hugo Chavez was in his heyday.

This occurred two hours after a quake with a magnitude of 5.5 caused severe damages. The epicenter was located at 42.97º N and 13.13º E. It reached a depth of 20 km.
Earlier, on October 26, at 17:10:36.3 UTC, a 5.5 magnitude temblor rumbled Central Italy. Its epicenter originating at coordinates 42:88º N and 13:13º E, with a depth of 9 km. Approximately 2,686,000 people were able to feel the thunderous rumbling.
Two hours after the 5.5 M earthquake destroyed several foundations to iconic buildings, in Central Italy, a relentless 6.1 magnitude temblor originated in the same proximity as the first one. Enduring two earthquakes, above a magnitude 5, increases the chances of significant damages, power outages, and possible flooding.
Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced that the injury reports, thus far, remain at zero. Several buildings have collapsed after a 6.1 magnitude earthquake occurred within two hours of a 5.5 M temblor rocked Central Italy.
Efforts to maintain the safety of the people is ongoing. Aftershocks are anticipated. Guardian Liberty Voice will provide any new information as it becomes available.

“I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings,” (Luke 16:9 NIV).
“Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword,” (Matthew 10:34 NIV).
“From that time on Jesus began to preach, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near,'” (Matthew 4:17 NIV).
“You should not be surprised at my saying, ‘You must be born again,'” (John 3:7 NIV).
Conservatives tend to be more charitable than liberals on average, BTW. It says in 2 Corinthians that God loves a cheerful giver. Socialism would hinder the ability to give freely and out of your heart instead of compulsion.
Additionally, the reason why Jesus “hung out with” sinners is that He wanted to change their evil ways and put their faith in Him:
“Jesus answered them, ‘It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick,'” (Luke 5:31 NIV).
“‘Haven’t you read,’ he replied, ‘that at the beginning the Creator “made them male and female,” and said, “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh”? So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate,’” (Matthew 19:4-6 NIV).
So Jesus certainly did not support gay marriage.
“Jesus answered, ‘I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me,'” (John 14:6 NIV).
So much for the relativism that liberalism is inseparable from.
And if the Pentateuch is too conservative for you, just remember that when He was tempted, Jesus Quote: d from Deuteronomy every time.
Liberalism came from the pagan Enlightenment, not Christianity. You strain a gnat and swallow a camel, as Jesus would say to you.
You dare call yourself a good clergyman, fool? Shame on you for believing the lies of the liberal apostates. You say you are clergy, yet clearly you know nothing about the Scriptures, nor do you know God.
If that is the case with you, then this describes you quite accurately:
“For certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord,” (Jude 1:4 NIV).
“But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!” (Galatians 1:8 NIV).",english,2016-11-12T08:51:34.735+02:00,guardianlv.com,US,51784,Christianity and Liberalism Cannot Exist Together,0,http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/liberal-christian.jpg,40,25,0,0,0,bs

Disgraced Robert Creamer is having even more of his dirty laundry aired by James O’Keefe and Project Veritas. Wonder how his commie wife, Congresswoman and fellow Marxist, Jan Schakowsky , feels about that. It would seem that Creamer was beyond cozy with the Clinton campaign. He has been on daily morning calls with the campaign with his input. He’s also, not surprisingly, worked directly with Obama to organize “issue campaigns.” 
Robert Creamer has been a political organizer and strategist for almost four decades. He and his firm, the Strategic Consulting Group, work with many of the country’s most significant issue campaigns. He was one of the major architects and organizers of the successful campaign to defeat the privatization of Social Security. He worked to end the war in Iraq, pass universal healthcare, change America’s budget priorities and enact comprehensive immigration reform. He’s been a very busy little Marxist. 
His clients have included labor unions, public interest groups and advocacy organizations like MoveOn.org, Americans United for Change and USAction. He has also worked on hundreds of electoral campaigns at the local, state and national levels. 
Now he is best known for getting caught up in a sting by Project Veritas. He also accepted a foreign donation for a Democratic Super PAC for $20,000. Then he returned it once he suspected he was being set up. A little too late, Bob. That donation was from Project Veritas themselves. 
From Breitbart : 
Disgraced Democratic operative Robert Creamer participated in daily calls with the Hillary Clinton campaign, and worked directly with President Barack Obama to organize “issue campaigns.” 
Creamer makes the admissions in the latest undercover video release from James O’Keefe and Project Veritas, which captured Creamer describing his activities. 
O’Keefe also reports that Creamer accepted a foreign donation for a Democratic super PAC. 
In this fourth video in the series, “Rigging the Election,” Creamer tells a journalist with Project Veritas that he does indeed work for the Clinton campaign and is in fact in charge of “overseeing” activities at the Trump rallies: “I mean frankly I spend most of my time overseeing the Trump event rallies, I mean that’s what I do for the Clinton campaign.” He has actively choreographed “bird dogging” at Trump’s rallies to gin up violence. He’s also placed infiltrators in Donald Duck costumes at Trump events. So lame. This has been going on for more than a year. 
Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, flat out lied last week and said he never worked with Creamer. But O’Keefe’s videos expose that whopper of a lie. 
In this latest video, Creamer details some of his connections: “Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters … I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising.” Even more damning is a conference call mentioned where they discussed a woman potentially coming forward against Trump to accuse him of inappropriate behavior. 
Creamer has known and worked with Obama since the 1980s, during his community organizing days. He goes on to add: “I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the… the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.” 
I assume there will be even more videos to come. Creamer has resigned from Americans United for Change over all this and his reputation is now trashed. This is what happens when you make your living scheming against others. Eventually you get caught up in it as well.

b99a4898501d8d9fc8c97f2440acaf564d21b1a3,0,Admin - Orissa,2016-10-26T21:57:58.163+03:00,Allergens in Vaccines Are Causing Life-Threatening Food Allergies,"Children’s Medical Safety Research Institute 
It would probably surprise few people to hear that food allergies are increasingly common in U.S. children and around the world . According to one public health website , food allergies in children aged 0-17 in the U.S. increased by 50% from 1997 to 2011. 
Although food allergies are now so widespread as to have become almost normalized, it is important to realize that millions of American children and adults suffer from severe rapid-onset allergic reactions that can be life-threatening. Foods represent the most common cause of anaphylaxis among children and adolescents. The United Kingdom has witnessed a 700% increase in hospital admissions for anaphylaxis and a 500% increase in admissions for food allergy since 1990. 
The question that few are asking is why life-threatening food allergies have become so alarmingly pervasive. A 2015 open access case report by Vinu Arumugham in the Journal of Developing Drugs , entitled “ Evidence that Food Proteins in Vaccines Cause the Development of Food Allergies and Its Implications for Vaccine Policy ,” persuasively argues that allergens in vaccines—and specifically food proteins—may be the elephant in the room. Historical Perspective 
As Arumugham points out, scientists have known for over 100 years that injecting proteins into humans or animals causes immune system sensitization to those proteins. And, since the 1940s, researchers have confirmed that food proteins in vaccines can induce allergy in vaccine recipients. Arumugham is not the first to bring the vaccine-allergy link to the public’s attention. Heather Fraser makes a powerful case for the role of vaccines in precipitating peanut allergies in her 2011 book, The Peanut Allergy Epidemic: What’s Causing It and How to Stop It . In that fascinating book, Fraser notes that mass allergic phenomena (called “serum sickness” at the time) first emerged at the close of the nineteenth century in tandem with mass vaccination. Allergens in Vaccines 
What food proteins are found in vaccines? The list includes ovalbumin, casein, gelatin, and soy. As Arumugham ascertained, however, synthetic vaccine ingredients such as polysorbate 80 and sorbitol also are sourced from food items, including coconut, palm, sunflower, wheat, and corn. Arumugham observes that it is likely impossible to fully eliminate residual allergen proteins deriving from these sources. Moreover, it takes very low-level exposure to food proteins to cause allergic sensitization. Synergy with aluminum-based adjuvants 
A more subtle and troubling point is that the aluminum adjuvants contained in many vaccines augment the food proteins’ immunogenicity (a substance’s ability to provoke an immune response). When numerous food proteins and adjuvants get injected in one sitting, as is the case when multiple shots are administered simultaneously, the probability of sensitization greatly increases. Implications 
The Institute of Medicine admits that food proteins in vaccines “occasionally induce…sensitization…and subsequent hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.” Despite this knowledge, the allergen content in vaccines is entirely unregulated. No safe level or limits have ever been established or enforced for the allergens contained in vaccines . 
In this context, it is hard to disagree with Arumugham’s suggested solutions. The most obvious response—one that would likely alleviate much suffering—is to remove food proteins and aluminum compounds from vaccines as soon as possible. To decrease the odds of allergic sensitization, it also makes sense to adopt the precaution of decelerating the vaccine schedule and administering one vaccine at a time. In the interim, the link between vaccines and food allergies needs to be openly discussed so that the public can be more fully informed about vaccine risks.

Medical Doctors Opposed to Forced Vaccinations – Should Their Views be Silenced? eBook – Available for immediate download. 
One of the biggest myths being propagated in the compliant mainstream media today is that doctors are either pro-vaccine or anti-vaccine, and that the anti-vaccine doctors are all “quacks.” 
However, nothing could be further from the truth in the vaccine debate. Doctors are not unified at all on their positions regarding “the science” of vaccines, nor are they unified in the position of removing informed consent to a medical procedure like vaccines. 
The two most extreme positions are those doctors who are 100% against vaccines and do not administer them at all, and those doctors that believe that ALL vaccines are safe and effective for ALL people, ALL the time, by force if necessary. 
Very few doctors fall into either of these two extremist positions, and yet it is the extreme pro-vaccine position that is presented by the U.S. Government and mainstream media as being the dominant position of the medical field. 
In between these two extreme views, however, is where the vast majority of doctors practicing today would probably categorize their position. Many doctors who consider themselves “pro-vaccine,” for example, do not believe that every single vaccine is appropriate for every single individual. 
Many doctors recommend a “delayed” vaccine schedule for some patients, and not always the recommended one-size-fits-all CDC childhood schedule. Other doctors choose to recommend vaccines based on the actual science and merit of each vaccine, recommending some, while determining that others are not worth the risk for children, such as the suspect seasonal flu shot. 
These doctors who do not hold extreme positions would be opposed to government-mandated vaccinations and the removal of all parental exemptions. 
In this eBook, I am going to summarize the many doctors today who do not take the most extremist pro-vaccine position, which is probably not held by very many doctors at all, in spite of what the pharmaceutical industry, the federal government, and the mainstream media would like the public to believe.

The White house is refusing to deny the rumors that President Obama claimed he will relocate to Canada if Donald Trump is elected as his successor in November. 
The rumor began when Canadian satire website The Burred Street Journal ran a fictional story titled “Obama Declares His Family Will Move To Canada If Trump Is Elected.” 
The story was complete with a fake statement from Obama which read, “It’s something Michelle, the kids and I have discussed as a potential solution to the Donald. I have also spoken with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau who outlined Canada’s generous immigration policy for wealthy individuals, so we’ll see.” 
The story was immediately picked up by American newsrooms, who ran it with headlines like “Obama Just Said He’s Moving If Trump Is Elected, Sounds Good To Us!” 
When asked about the rumors, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not say outright that Obama is not considering a move to Canada should the American people elect Trump. 
“He’s working very hard to make sure that nobody has to leave the country as a result of an electoral outcome that the president doesn’t support,” said Earnest, according to MRC Blog . 
While this all originated as a rumor, the White House’s decision not to categorically deny the reports had any validity only makes it appear as though Obama may actually consider moving out of the country if Trump is elected.

Biden said he’d like to throw down with Trump … now Trump responds. Did Biden see this coming? He should have, it’s Trump! 
We all knew it would happen, 2016 has been a roller coaster of crazy and unruly behavior from the left and their minions…that it would only be fitting to end it with a duel. 
All that’s left now is for each opponent to choose their weapon. 
Donald Trump responded to Biden’s statement very literally. Stating he “would really love” to accept the challenge to a fistfight. 
I can see Biden swinging wildly already…with his eyes shut and his head ducked. 
Biden on Friday slammed Trump’s now infamous taped 2005 comments that famous men could mistreat women with impunity: ‘When you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p****. You can do anything.’ 
Asked if he wished he could debate Trump, a furious Biden replied that he wished he were in high school so ‘I could take him behind the gym.’ 
Trump, 70, cast himself as the alpha male Tuesday night in Tallahassee, delivering the rhetorical equivalent of a ‘Let’s step outside’ to the 73-year-old Biden. 
Seriously though, since this campaign for President is already pure madness. Lets just pretend they were about to get down in a boxing match…who do you think would win?

Vitamin D is one of the most important vitamins you can give your body. 
This vitamin can affect nearly 2,000 genes in your body, and the best part of it is that you don’t even need a supplement to get your full recommended amount of vitamin D – you only need to get out in the sun for a few minutes a day. 
Vitamin D is beneficial for staving off depression. Without the required amount of vitamin D in your diet (or the necessary amount of time spent in the sun), you can experience and excessively low mood and other signs of depression. 
And one of the most well-known and important benefits of vitamin D is the effect it has an calcium absorption and building healthy bones. 
This is especially important for children, as the vitamin helps with bone growth as well as developing strong teeth. Those who do not have enough vitamin D may find themselves at risk for fractures or soft bones. 
Thus, vitamin D is not only important for children, but also women who can be susceptible to brittle bones as they age. 
The vitamin may also play a crucial role in helping your body ward off disease. Studies suggest that getting in enough vitamin D can help ward off multiple sclerosis, heart disease and help your body steer clear of the dreaded flu. 
If you don’t get enough vitamin D, you may find yourself feeling tired or experiencing general aches and pains. If the deficiency is severe enough, you may also find yourself developing stress fractures. 
So how do you get enough vitamin D in your diet? 
You can always purchase supplements, most of which contain enough, or in some cases, more than enough of your daily recommended allowance. 
It is also naturally found in salmon, sardines, egg yolk and shrimp. Milk, cereal, yogurt and orange juice are often fortified with vitamin D to ensure that you get the recommended amount. 
For those who live in a sunny climate, spending 10 minutes outside per day can actually give you the required amount of vitamin D. Although it is not advisable to spend too long outside without protection from the sun in the form of sun block or extra layers of clothing, it is recommended that you do get outside for at least a small part of the day to soak up those rays. 
You can, however, get all of the benefits of vitamin D in your diet or by taking supplements during the winter months when the sun takes a rest, or if you happen to live in a colder climate.

In June of 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) put forward a proposal to regulate the short-term loan industry. 
The Small Dollar Lending Rule seeks to “alleviate and solve” for the “apparent weaknesses” of the current rates and short-term lenders by requiring “lenders to assess and verify a borrower’s income, housing costs, and credit and legal obligations.” 
The intention of the proposal is to protect low-income families from being caught in an endless cycle where many are “forced to take out another loan to make ends meet.” At first glance, it seems that the rule would solve problems in an industry known for its “dirtiness.” Except policymakers are thinking with their hearts while sitting in their air-conditioned offices, away from the facts and any form of interaction with the real world of short-term loans. Just the fact that they see the short-term loan industry as “dirty” supplies sufficient reason to believe that either these policymakers are ignorantly prejudiced or plainly manipulative. 
Instead of pointing fingers and name calling at the short-term lending industry, they should be applying simple economics to their proposals to see if they hold water. 
In “Understanding the CFPB Proposal for Payday and Other Small Loans,” a paper released by the CFPB and PEW Charitable Trusts, the Bureau aimed to make several arguments in favor of new legislation. 
The first of its arguments is that, “with payday and vehicle title loan markets, lenders’ and borrowers’ interests are not aligned because profitability for lenders depends on loans being unaffordable for customers.” But doesn’t this argument stand for any industry that sells a product? 
For example, are the interests of iPhone sellers and buyers “aligned” in the manner acceptable to the CFPB? Each additional iPhone 6 is said to cost $200.10 to produce and is sold for $699 dollars. That is 3 times its cost to make. To borrow a phrase from the left, that’s “price-gouging” to the tune of 300 percent. Yet there is no noise from policymakers claiming to call Apple a company that cheats its customers. 
So why should short-term lenders be held accountable in any way that is different than Apple? Shouldn’t short-term lenders be able to charge interest rates that make-up for the huge risk they incur in lending money out to low-income borrowers? 
Studies show these lenders charge on average 15 percent, or $15 for every $100 loaned — a profit margin that is significantly less than the price percentage difference of products in other markets. 
The second of the CFPB’s arguments is that to solve for “balloon payments,” or the cycle of continued borrowing to pay off loans, the CFPB would “require that most products become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments.” 
The problem with this statement is that the Bureau completely ignores the reason why short-term loans are so available to borrowers — it’s because short-term loan companies can offset risk by requiring borrowers to weigh their own risk against their need to borrow. 
Simply put, the short payment periods are put in place to deter those who definitely should not borrow. Additionally, making the periods longer and the payments smaller defeats the business model, making short-term lenders irrelevant because their models are defined by their expediency. 
The third of the CFPB’s arguments is that their proposal would solve the “problems” related to “price gouge lending” by requiring “lenders to evaluate borrowers’ financial condition,” by forcing borrowers to submit written statements on income, housing expenses, all outstanding debt, and child support. Meanwhile, the lender is required to obtain a national credit report, and then deliver that data to all proposed credit tracking agencies. 
Remember: all of these government-imposed requirements cost the short-term lenders money. The cost of finding out this data would eliminate any ability that firms have to loan small amounts of cash at current interest rates. The result would either lead short-term loan companies to shut down or further hurt borrowers by requiring that they borrow larger sums of money to qualify for loans. 
Lastly, the CFPB heralds that their redesign is prompted by a study by The Pew Charitable Trusts’ survey research that the “vast majority of borrowers want … most products [to] become installment loans with smaller, manageable payments.” 
At first glance, it seems that borrowers in need are hurting and want to find a way out of a difficult situation. Although there are those who are caught in the inability to pay back loans because they got caught in bad finance (due to the risk of short-term loans), many of those “surveyed” actually sent in raving reviews in support of short-term loans. 
In fact, more than 98 percent of the 12,308 submissions to the Bureau’s “ Tell Your Story ” program — where people sent in their experiences regarding short-term loans — were positive and excessively thankful for these loans. 
These responses ranged from, “there are no other avenues out there that can lend money like [this],” to a simple “thank you.” This study was personally conducted by the CFPB. Unsatisfied with the results, they hid it from the public’s view until a Freedom of Information Act request forced them to release it. 
This holding back of information demonstrates that the Bureau is not truly searching to help the people it says it wants to help. Rather, they have a keen eye for policy symbolism, and the flash of “fighting for the underdog” when in fact they are irreversibly harming them while sticking a knife in their back. 
Policymakers continue the belief that short-term loans are as bad as they seem comes either because they did not attend their economics classes in college, or they simply want to be perceived as “someone who cares.” But we cannot let policymakers make decisions because their hearts lead them to make uneducated proposals. We cannot let legislators sway our hearts because we hear about the extreme situations where people are hurt. Instead, we need to look at the cold-hard facts: the numbers that the CFPB uses to defend their arguments are manipulative and outright false. 
The Small Dollar Lending Rule must not be allowed to pass and the proposal must be removed and taken back — it will only hurt the people it claims it will help. Let Americans make decisions for themselves — they’re smarter and more risk-averse than Washington insiders give them credit for.

Establishment politicians and press are outraged that Trump would question the integrity of their system. 
They say it undermines public trust in political institutions. 
Yet to see who is truly undermining public trust we need look no further than the people running the elections, who are shutting down election audit procedures, who stonewall and eject certified election monitors and who make any recording of malfunctioning voting machines a felony. 
One such person is Texas Director of Elections, Keith Ingram. 
This story is specific to Texas, but the same tactics are used nationwide by both parties to exploit vulnerabilities inherent in electronic voting. 
I went to the Texas Secretary of State offices to ask Mr. Ingram about specific procedural changes he has made in his 4 year tenure and the changes he attempted to make in August that would have gone into effect this November. 
With camera & mic in hand, we told the reception desk that we were with the press and would like to talk to the Director about the election. 
We were told to wait in the lobby and Mr. Ingram would be down. 
You can see for yourself what happened when he saw the mic flag showing we were with Infowars. 
The man running the election bureaucracy runs from questions. 
So much for transparency and candor. 
This unelected bureaucrat is tasked with ensuring that counties adhere to election law. 
What follows are the specific actions taken by his office that waive requirements and undermine election integrity in Texas. 
But before we get to specifics about his actions & his connection to the Rose Law firm in Arkansas, there are some general questions that should concern voters nationwide: 
• Why would standards required by our elected lawmakers for election integrity be bent to the capabilities of vendors rather than require vendors to perform to the standard? 
• Why would election procedures be waived and honesty and transparency sacrificed for the convenience of election workers & officials? 
Burning The Paper Trail 
In August 2016, Ingram, Texas Director of Elections, attempted to make last minute rule changes for the upcoming November 8 election that would eliminate crucial paper backup records for electronic voting. His office issued new rules that would: 
Eliminate printing of paper audit logs that poll watchers are entitled to monitor at main tabulation computers. 
Eliminate printing of Early Voting Results tapes. 
Eliminate printing of ballot images for recounts. 
Fortunately activists and some elected representatives got the proposed rule changes postponed, with a formal public hearing scheduled after the November election. 
State Senator Don Huffines said “The state’s chief election officers must reconsider and redraft their proposed election rules to pursue more real-time paper records and backups, not fewer…The comfort & convenience of election administrators should not take priority over voters’ confidence and election integrity.” 
But even though these procedures have been postponed, Ingram’s previous rule changes are still a cause for concern in the November election and have caused repercussions in two election cases currently being litigated. Here are some of the problems… 
1) Waiver of laws requiring a Partial Manual Recount audit 
Ingram waived the requirement to conduct a manual count in 1% of the election precincts or 3 election precincts, whichever is greater. This was waived in all 254 counties the day after the March 2016 Primary. The timing is significant because during the primary there were 1,743 move votes than voters in Hill County in the Republican Primary. The margin of victory was 225 in Texas House District 8 that contains Hill County. In calling for a criminal investigation, Ingram noted that it appears “6 or 7 voters voted more than once in the election and one voter voted as many as four times.” Yet he waived the partial manual recount audit requirement statewide and he has waived other audit and monitoring procedures. 
2) Waiver of laws requiring printing of paper backup results tapes 
Ingram’s waivers issued in 2014, 2015, and 2016, appear to be in direct contradiction of state election laws 65.004, 65.014, 66.022, 66.023, 66.024 and the Judges Handbook. These rules require – • “Three original tally lists shall be maintained at the polling place to record the number of votes received for the candidates” • “On completion of the vote count, the presiding judge shall prepare the returns of the election for the precinct” with “total number of voters”, “total number of votes” with the presiding judge signing each of the 3 copies to certify. 
Ingram also issued waivers for requirements that a “zero tape” be printed from the machines at the beginning of election day and a “tally tape” printed at the close of election. His letter states that “the process of printing of the zero tape and tally tape at each countywide precinct location could take hours in both the morning and the evening of election day.” 
So expediency for election workers takes precedent over requirements enacted by the legislature for integrity of elections. And if a favored vendor can’t perform to the law, the law is waived. 
If proper procedures had been followed to ensure that the machine was at a zero state, instead of waived by Ingram, the Hill County issue of 1,743 more voters than votes would not have happened. The vendor in Hill County, ES&S eventually identified the source of the extra votes saying “An audit of the log report from the central paper ballot scanner showed that the hard drive had not been properly cleared of all ballots cast before scanning Early Voting or Election Day ballots…There are established election protocols which should be followed to prevent this type of reporting error.” 
But the Director of Elections is waiving those “established election protocols”. Ingram’s waver of legal requirements & his improvised solution of “printing a zero tape at the county warehouse prior to election day” opens the door for error and fraud. 
3) Ignoring laws requiring printing of legally sufficient ballot images for recounts 
The Secretary of State Election Division claims that “cast vote records” are equivalent to “ballot images”. As you can see, the cast vote records are very different from ballots and are not uniquely numbered. 
The Texas Constitution, Article 6 – Suffrage, Section 4 says “In all elections by the people, the vote shall be by ballot, and the Legislature shall provide for the numbering of tickets and make such other regulations as may be necessary to detect and punish fraud and preserve the purity of the ballot box.” 
Yet the machines by vendors Hart InterCivic and ES&S, certified by Ingram, do not provide uniquely numbered ballots per state recount laws and don’t provide other components of a legal Texas ballot. 
4) Ignoring laws that allow poll watchers to monitor all election activities such as the printing of paper audit logs for computerized result tabultion 
Texas Election Code, Sec 33.056 says a “watcher is entitled to observe any activity conducted at the location at which the watcher is serving.” 
Affidavits from two official poll watchers for a candidate in Dallas County (with official Poll Watcher signed forms) detail how they were “repeatedly obstructed from monitoring multiple election activities at the Dallas County Central Counting Station such as ballot scanning, vote transfer, ballot transfer, computer activities, ballot tabulation, and viewing the elections computer line printer.” They state that they were “repeatedly treated disrespectfully, obstructed and blatantly ignored” by the election officials, and voting machine vendor before being thrown out after the officials spoke with the Texas Secretary of State Elections office. 
Hostility to election monitors, like Ingram’s refusal to answer our questions, destroy the public’s confidence in the honesty of the process — and rightfully so. 
Ingram’s Connections To Arkansas, Kutak Rock, Rose Law Firm & Hillary Clinton 
According to a public information request of Ingram’s Secretary of State personnel file, Ingram left private practice and moved to Little Rock Arkansas, taking a job with the law firm, Kutak Rock, LL. At Kutak Rock, he worked under the managing partner, Gordon Miller Wilbourn who had been a partner with Hillary Clinton, Vince Foster and Webster Hubbell at the Rose Law Firm in Arkansas in the 1990’s. The Wilbourn family is a large donor to the Clinton Foundation and the Hillary Clinton campaign. 
Ingram left Kutak Rock to return to Texas when he was hired by Gov. Rick Perry’s appointment office in 2008 to oversee statewide political appointments for various courts, boards & commissions. 
Ingrams’s career moves are interesting. In just 10 months, his journey from private practice in Texas through Arkansas Clinton-cronies and back to Texas government resulted in pay cuts with each move and his salary being cut in half. In 2012, Ingram, was promoted to Director of the Election Division in the Texas Secretary of State’s Office where his salary was still 40% less than private practice. 
Ingram’s determination to remove paper trails and auditing procedures for electronic voting is even more troubling when we look at his connections to big Clinton donors. 
Establishment Of Both Parties Don’t Appear To Want Election Integrity 
In one lawsuit contesting election results for Austin City Council, the County could not produce ANY ballot images as required by law to conduct a recount. Computer logs had multiple “corruption/invalid” errors. During discovery it was learned that the computer counted more votes than registered voters in 10 of the 12 precincts forming the district. One precinct had 100% voter turnout, another was just 2 registered voters shy of 100% in spite of only 32% and 17% county-wide turnout in the general and runoff elections. 
The County Democrat Party has financed legal opposition to the lawsuit and a Republican judge claimed there was no evidence for election irregularities. 
There are some positive developments, however. The Republican judge has now been voted off the bench of the solidly Republican County and state legislators have taken up the question of election integrity that has so far been ignored by Governor Abbott’s office. 
State Senator Bob Hall said, “Due to an increasing number of complaints, it is time for the Texas Elections Division Office to take immediate and decisive action to rescind all waivers issued by that office…and instruct all Texas counties using electronic voting systems to consistently adhere to all election laws…” 
Voters, regardless of political affiliation, should reject policies and personnel that compromise honest, transparent elections. For example, Chambers County in Texas recently announced electronic voting would be suspended until the glitches affecting voting machines could be corrected. It’s time to remove Keith Ingram as Texas Director of Elections and replace easily hacked electronic voting machines with paper ballots.",english,2016-10-26T21:54:53.756+03:00,infowars.com,US,2774,Levers of Power: Flushing the Vote Down the Memory Hole,0,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10-25-16-director-tx.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,conspiracy

Two months after being purged from the border town of Jarablus in northern Syria by a Turkish-led force — and just days after being targeted by Turkish airstrikes near al-Bab — Syrian Kurds now fear a “stab in the back” from Turkey’s military as plans for a U.S.-led push to clear ISIS fighters from Raqqa are carried out. 
“It is very important Raqqa is liberated,” a chief political leader of the main Syrian Kurdish party, the PYD, told Reuters . “But one point which is bothering us is that, if we go toward Raqqa, we will be stabbed from the back.” 
At the end of August, Turkish forces took part in a U.S.-led operation to eject ISIS from the northern border of Syria. Once inside Syria, however, Turkish forces — leading Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels — took aim at Kurdish fighters in the town of Jarablus, which sent them scurrying across the Euphrates River in retreat. 
The issue here is that the U.S. claims to find the Kurds useful in the fight against ISIS. The Kurds, in fact, make up a significant portion of one of the primary U.S.-supplied rebel forces in the region. As Reuters explains : 
“Kurdish militia have played a big role in the past year in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed umbrella group, as it has seized large areas of territory from Islamic State, laying the ground for an assault on Raqqa. 
“However, Turkey’s intervention in Syria in August in support of rebel groups fighting under the Free Syrian Army (FSA) banner has complicated that equation, leading to clashes between them and Kurdish groups allied to the SDF.” 
The problem is one of trust. Turkey believes the Kurdish militants are aligned with the Kurdish PYD party, which the Turks believe is allied with Kurds within Turkey who’ve been waging a religious insurgency for over three decades. 
So regardless of whether the U.S. finds the Kurds useful, Turkey has made it clear it intends to sleep with one eye open for the foreseeable future. In fact, it’s taking a much more proactive stance than that. 
Last Thursday, in a campaign of airstrikes that were “the heaviest against the YPG since Turkey launched a military incursion into Syria,” Turkey targeted three Kurdish-controlled villages along the northern Syrian border. The Turkish military later confirmed it had carried out “26 strikes on areas recently taken by the Kurdish YPG militia” and “had killed between 160 and 200 combatants.” 
Turkey’s major concern is that Kurdish-controlled enclaves will physically unite, “thereby creating a de facto Kurdish mini-state along the Turkish border.” As such, Turkey has warned Kurds to keep out of towns like Manjib, which is just northeast of the heaviest fighting in Aleppo. 
This tangled web of strained alliances and old feuds will likely only grow more confusing as the U.S.-led operation to purge ISIS from Raqqa draws nearer. In any case, Turkish President Erdogan seems to have discovered a newfound independence , and the days of him obediently — even if somewhat grudgingly — bending to the U.S. will appear to be fading, as well. 
“From now on we will now wait for problems to come knocking on our door, we will not wait until the blade is against our bone and skin, we will not wait for terrorist organizations to come and attack us,” Erdogan said from his palace last week. “Let them go wherever until we find and destroy them. I am saying this very clearly: they will not have a single place to find peace abroad.” NEWSLETTER SIGN UP Get the latest breaking news & specials from Alex Jones and the Infowars Crew.

Darius Shahtahmasebi | Anti Media - October 26, 2016 Comments 
Last week, the U.S. State Department acknowledged that al-Qaeda-linked terror group Jabhat al-Nusra is not a “priority” for the United States’ efforts in Syria. 
One might ask, then: if al-Qaeda in Syria is not a priority for the war on terror, what is? 
State Department spokesman John Kirby provided some useful insight into this dilemma, stating: 
“The only thing that stands between where we are now and a permanent and enduring ceasefire in Syria is Bashar al-Assad and his supporters . We recognize Al-Nusra as a spoiler, we have concerns about co-mingling, I’ve talked about this ad nauseam.” 
Largely missing from the American narrative of the Syrian conflict is that al-Nusra is shelling residential areas in Aleppo, where the government holds control of the majority of Aleppo’s citizens. In other parts of the world, these al-Qaeda-linked extremists are seen as the enemy, whereas in Syria, Western media will often refer to them as mere “rebel” groups. 
The United States first officially used the term “war on terror” on September 20, 2011, to refer to the military campaigns that followed the attacks of September 11. The stated aim at the time was to defeat Islamic-linked terrorist organizations and dismantle regimes the U.S. government accused of supporting terrorism. 
In 2013, Obama stated : 
“ We must define our effort not as a boundless ‘Global War on Terror,’ but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.” 
The fact that a terror group — one linked to the organization that allegedly launched an act of war against the United States on American soil — is not a priority of the United States State Department should tell you something about how farcical and ineffective the war on terror actually is. 
This change in rhetoric, which is ultimately designed to push ulterior economic agendas in the Middle East, is an insult to the thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their lives under the false pretense that they were going to protect their families from al-Qaeda-linked terrorists.

TO MANY WHO conduct work or research related to digital security, the legislation meant to protect against computer crimes has morphed into something harmful. The 1986 law, the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, has been repeatedly described as vague and ineffectual — allowing overzealous prosecutors to saddle hacktivists and low-level criminals with excessive sentences. 
Now, thanks to a legal challenge to the CFAA, the Department of Justice is for the first time releasing its 2014 guidelines on how prosecutors should charge computer crimes — when someone exceeds “authorized” access on a computer. (First Look Media, the publisher of The Intercept, is a plaintiff in the case.) 
The Department of Justice acknowledges that “laws addressing the misuse of computers have not kept pace uniformly with developments in technology and criminal schemes” though it maintains that the law remains “important” in prosecuting cybercrimes. 
Some of the prosecutions under the CFAA have proved controversial. Aaron Swartz, a well-known internet activist who downloaded academic journals en masse, faced years of grueling legal trials under the CFAA before he committed suicide. And Andrew Auernheimer was found guilty of conspiracy to violate the CFAA by uncovering AT&T customer data exposed on the company website.",english,2016-10-26T22:20:26.479+03:00,infowars.com,US,2774,Justice Department Releases Guidelines on Controversial Anti-Hacking Law,0,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/doj-department-justice.jpg,0,1,12,0,12,conspiracy

The federal government is trying to recoup enlistment bonuses given erroneously to thousands of California soldiers despite routinely allowing poor-performing VA employees to keep their bonus checks. 
The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the Pentagon demanded that thousands of California soldiers repay bonuses they were given to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Department asked the soldiers to repay the bonuses, which amounted to $15,000 or more each, after audits revealed they were overpaid by the California National Guard. 
But the practice stands in contrast with that of the Obama administration’s Department of Veterans Affairs, which has failed to take back hundreds of thousands of dollars paid to high-ranking bureaucrats who have been scrutinized for bad behavior or poor management. 
For instance, the VA said last year it would not collect over $400,000 in bonuses paid to two senior executives who manipulated the agency’s hiring system to take new jobs with less responsibility and receive relocation benefits. The VA, which acknowledged that the employees abused the system, said it did not have the legal authority to recoup the money.",english,2016-10-26T23:12:59.857+03:00,infowars.com,US,2774,"Obama Admin Targets Soldiers’ Bonuses, Lets Bad VA Employees Keep Theirs",0,http://hw.infowars.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Obama-1.jpg,0,1,75,0,75,conspiracy

Shortly after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the Pentagon hired Bell Pottinger, a London-based PR agency. The PR firm was tasked with promoting what the Pentagon called “democratic elections” in Iraq, ultimately earning over a hundred million dollars yearly. Part of the firm’s job included producing “fake al Qaeda propaganda films,” the Bureau of Investigative Journalism recently reported . 
Despite the PR operation’s hefty price tag, the Pentagon seemed to have no issue allocating taxpayer resources to have these videos produced. But over ten years after the Iraq invasion, the Pentagon is now concerned about its past appropriations — at least part of them, anyway. 
Ten years after promising $15,000 bonuses to soldiers willing to re-enlist in 2006 and 2007, the Pentagon is now forcing California veterans to pay back the bonuses. 
The Los Angeles Times reports , “officials signed up soldiers in assembly-line fashion” in 2006 and 2007, outlining the “generous terms available for six-year reenlistments” to those willing to sacrifice their safety, leaving their homes, once again, to fight abroad in exchange for a large bonus. Now, the Pentagon wants their money back. To Get Soldiers to Re-enlist, the National Guard Lied 
In 2008, the movie Stop-Loss highlighted a reality few members of the public were informed about. 
With the growing involvement of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers who had already served in Iraq and Afghanistan for several tours were being asked to reenlist. Sometimes, these soldiers’ term duties were extended forcefully via the government’s controversial stop-loss policy , which allows the government to extend the period a soldier must spend on active duty involuntarily. 
In California, the state’s National Guard began promising thousands of soldiers that they would receive $15,000 bonuses for going back to war. 
Now, nearly 10,000 soldiers who took the National Guard’s promise at face value are being ordered to pay back the bonuses plus interest. In some cases, their wages are being garnished to fund the payments. 
This issue was first brought up when veterans “ whose only mistake was to accept bonuses offered when the Pentagon needed to fill the ranks” were the target of an investigation launched in 2010. 
After receiving reports of improper payments, a federal probe found “thousands of bonuses and student loan payments were given to California Guard soldiers who did not qualify for them, or were approved despite paperwork errors.” 
As a result of the investigation, Army Master Sgt. Toni Jaffe, who also served as the California Guard’s incentive manager, pleaded guilty to filing false claims totaling $15.2 million in 2011. Jaffe was sentenced to spend 30 months in federal prison, and three other officers who also pleaded guilty to fraud were put on probation. 
Breaking the National Guard’s promise to soldiers whose reenlistment depended on the bonus distribution, the California Guard “assigned 42 auditors to comb through paperwork for bonuses and other incentive payments given to 14,000 soldiers.” 
In September 2016, these auditors finalized the investigation, finding roughly 9,700 current and retired soldiers who had been given “improper” bonuses. These soldiers have been told “to repay some or all of their bonuses” since the probe was launched and the first cases were discovered. 
According to the California National Guard, these repayments have recovered more than $22 million so far, compromising veterans like Robert Richmond, who now works for a construction company in Texas. He was an Army Sergeant First Class living in Huntington Beach when in 2006, he was asked to reenlist. 
“I signed a contract that I literally risked my life to fulfill,” Richmond explained , adding that he only agreed to go back to war because he was told he qualified for a $15,000 bonus as a special forces soldier. 
The veteran had gone through a divorce after being deployed to Afghanistan in 2002 and 2003. Asked to consider the bonus to reenlist, Richmond thought the money was going to give him “breathing room,” so he agreed. In 2007, he was sent to Iraq’s “ Triangle of Death ,” an area a few miles south of Baghdad known for intense fighting. 
In one of the hundreds of missions against insurgents he was a part of, Richmond sustained permanent back and brain injuries after his vehicle triggered a roadside bomb. 
In 2014, the California Guard headquarters contacted him, letting the former special forces soldier know he was being urged to repay the $15,000 bonus he received in 2006. If he failed to make the payment, the letter said , he would face “debt collection action.” 
Richmond refused to give the government any money back, filing appeal after appeal. “[Impacted soldiers] want somebody in the government, anybody, to say this is wrong and we’ll stop going after this money,” he said . ‘Support the Troops!’: Code for ‘Don’t Question War?’ 
In Washington, D.C., lawmakers have condemned the Pentagon, saying the soldiers were not at fault for accepting a bonus they were promised. 
Promising to open an investigation into the enlistment bonus problem, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) called the Pentagon’s demands “disgraceful.” 
“The Department of Defense should waive these repayments,” McCarthy said in a statement . “The House will investigate these reports to ensure our soldiers are fully honored for their service,” he added. 
Rep. McCarthy says the government should not be demanding any money back from veterans in his statement. The California Republican and also argued that “we are the ones who owe a debt for the great sacrifices our heroes have made — some of whom unfortunately paid the ultimate sacrifice.‎” 
Instead of using this opportunity to highlight the importance of safeguarding our soldiers and keeping them from engaging in unconstitutional wars that are only successfully sold to the American public because administrations lie , McCarthy celebrates these very soldiers’ sacrifices. 
Using this discussion to repeat the traditional “support the troops” line, lawmakers like McCarthy steer the debate away from what’s causing these soldiers so much pain and distress , acting as if relentless war hasn’t been the reason they were lied to. Instead, McCarthy and others are pushing the government to keep its promise without reevaluating how the U.S. government goes about irresponsibly sending these men and women abroad to fight insurgents who didn’t pose a threat to Americans at the time . 
In the 1964 film, The Americanization of Emily , which was based on a novel written by a veteran who had been a SeaBee officer on D-Day, character Lt. Comdr. Charles E. Madison gives a short speech explaining that “[those] who make heroes of our dead and shrines of our battlefields … perpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices.” 
Failing to discuss the real costs of war with the American electorate while exalting the sacrifices made by those who serve in the military is part of an ongoing campaign — deliberate or otherwise — to keep America involved in perpetual war. 
Don’t believe me? Don’t take my word for it. Instead, read what journalist Randolph Bourne had to say about the country’s thirst for war in 1918: In times of peace, we usually ignore the State in favour of partisan political controversies, or personal struggles for office, or the pursuit of party policies. It is the Government rather than the State with which the politically minded are concerned. The State is reduced to a shadowy emblem which comes to consciousness only on occasions of patriotic holiday. … “With the shock of war, however, the State comes into its own again. The Government, with no mandate from the people, without consultation of the people, conducts all the negotiations, the backing and filling, the menaces and explanations, which slowly bring it into collision with some other Government, and gently and irresistibly slides the country into war. 
War, Bourne concluded , “is the health of the state.” This is not because all individuals involved with governing enjoy death and destruction per se , but because “it is … in war that the urgency for union seems greatest, and the necessity for universality seems most unquestioned,” which forces the public to unite behind the state no matter what — especially if the occasion leading to war is “terrifying” the public. 
While veterans whose bonuses are being questioned ten years later should be heard and protected from government abuse, we must not forget it was government’s own thirst for war that initiated this cycle of deception. Let us not ignore the reasons why we should support our troops — and how we should go about it; simply claiming to be interested in celebrating U.S. soldiers for their sacrifice does nothing for them.",english,2016-10-26T21:22:44.272+03:00,intellihub.com,US,,The US Military lied to thousands of soldiers — and now Veterans are paying for it,0,https://www.intellihub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/usmc.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

This is one of the first of ten commandments blazoned across the Georgia Guidestones, an occult monument for which no person or organization has taken credit. Though the monument was commissioned by someone named R.C. Christian more than two decades ago, the true identity of the person who built this specter is still unidentified, and the message is but one of the many examples of a cabalistic desire to cull the population. 
There are many more ‘hidden’ in plain sight. 
The Georgie Guidestones state : 1. Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature. 2. Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness and diversity. 3. Unite humanity with a living new language. 4. Rule passion – faith – tradition – and all things with tempered reason. 5. Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts. 6. Let all nations rule internally resolving external disputes in a world court. 7. Avoid petty laws and useless officials. 8. Balance personal rights with social duties. 9. Prize truth – beauty – love – seeking harmony with the infinite. 10.Be not a cancer on the earth – Leave room for nature – Leave room for nature. 
Though some of these commandments seem harmless enough, the very first describes the supreme sentiment of the mysterious group of masons who erected the stones. If you want further narrative for what they bode, you don’t have to look far. As Stanford University Professor, Paul Ehrlich , the author of The Population Bomb states , “The first task is population control at home. How do we go about it? Many of my colleagues feel that some sort of compulsory birth regulation would be necessary to achieve such control. One plan often mentioned involves the addition of temporary sterilants to water supplies or staple food. Doses of the antidote would be carefully rationed by the government to produce the desired population size.” 
We can see clearly that the ‘elite’ class, intent on ridding the planet of its burdensome load, has already poisoned the water of 42 out of 50 states with lead . Pesticides and fertilizers poison the remaining states’ water along with the original 42 states. Male infertility is rising due to these contaminants, and premature births along with miscarriage are more common due to others. If the water doesn’t kill you, it will simply lobotomize you, or at least start the process. Harvard medical has pronounced that fluoridated water lowered IQ scores in children who drank it, and aluminum along with fluoride is a known neurotoxin, also contributing to the rising numbers of Alzheimer’s, Parkinsons, and similar neurodegenerative diseases. READ: 11 Common Symptoms of the Global Depopulation Slow Kill 
Should poisoning the water be insufficient to keep the population down, we can look to the advice of David Brower, once Executive Director of the Sierra Club and founder of the Friends of the Earth. He suggests that, “Childbearing [should be] a punishable crime against society, unless the parents hold a government license … All potential parents [should be] required to use contraceptive chemicals, the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing.” 
Forced and coerced sterilization at the hands of the Eugenics Board and other bodies is nothing new. Some investigators recently found that 148 female inmates in two California prisons were sterilized between 2006 to 2010 — and there may be 100 more incidents dating back to the late 1990s. One reporter wrote , “ The women were signed up for the surgery while they were pregnant and housed at either the California Institution for Women in Corona or Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla, which is now a men’s prison. 
Former inmates and prisoner advocates maintain that prison medical staff coerced the women, targeting those deemed likely to return to prison in the future. 
Crystal Nguyen, a former Valley State Prison inmate who worked in the prison’s infirmary during 2007, said she often overheard medical staff asking inmates who had served multiple prison terms to agree to be sterilized. 
“I was like, ‘Oh my God, that’s not right,’” Nguyen, 28, said. “ Do they think they’re animals, and they don’t want them to breed anymore? ” 
Today vaccines are used in a similar manner to help cull the population against their informed consent. Eugenicist, Bill Gates tried to ‘ field test ’ his HPV vaccine in India on indigenous young girls, but the Indian government eventually brought a stop to this. The Rockefeller family also quietly funds vaccines that alter a woman’s hormones to make her less likely to become pregnant or to maintain a pregnancy. A book titled Disciplining Reproduction by Adele E. Clark explains what the elites were planning as early as the 1930s. “ Other lines of current immunological contraceptive research continue to seek what, during the 1930s, Max Mason of the Rockefeller Foundation called “anti-hormones”: vaccines to block hormones needed for very early pregnancy and a vaccine to block the hormone needed for the surface of the egg to function properly .” 
Barack Obama’s top science advisor , John P. Holdren has also said : “ A program of sterilizing women after their second or third child, despite the relatively greater difficulty of the operation than vasectomy, might be easier to implement than trying to sterilize men . The development of a long-term sterilizing capsule that could be implanted under the skin and removed when pregnancy is desired opens additional possibilities for coercive fertility control. The capsule could be implanted at puberty and might be removable, with official permission, for a limited number of births.” 
A simple look at the peer-reviewed Plos One site offers over 7,500 additional scientific articles that connect vaccines to sterilization. 
Should vaccines or forced implants be insufficient to reduce the number of ‘useless eaters’ in the world, as Henry Kissinger has implied, then there is also the revealing text of Dr. John Colemann, who outlines the aims of a Committee of 300, otherwise known as the original hierarchical organization to plan a New World Order . Among their plans are genocide, war, the installation of dictators, the legalization of drug use, and the normalizing of pornography : “To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. It is interesting to note that Pol Pot’s genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Rome’s research foundations, and overseen by Thomas Enders, a high-ranking State Department official. It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia. “….To cause by means of limited wars in the advanced countries, by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries, the death of three billion people by the year 2050, people they call ‘useless eaters.’ The Committee of 300 (Illuminati) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide. The paper was produced under the title “Global 2000 Report” and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter, and Edwin Muskie, then Secretary of State, for and on behalf of the US Government. Under the terms of the Global 2000 Report, the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050. “……To encourage, and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an ‘art-form,’ which will be widely accepted and, eventually, become quite commonplace.” 
Look no further than Syria , Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, and a myriad other examples of false flag terrorism . Look no further than the top twenty pharmaceutical companies (all U.S., Illuminati based ) that control almost 99 percent of the world’s massive, ‘legalized’ drug trade. See clearly, the genocide happening around the globe , and the child sex trafficking and pornography which is silently abided in Hollywood, Washington, and in every government circle run by cabal-funded individuals. 
Look at the money usurped for the task of culling the masses, as former U.S. Secretary of State and presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton has stated : “This year, the United States renewed funding of reproductive healthcare through the United Nations Population Fund, and more funding is on the way. The U.S. Congress recently appropriated more than $648 million in foreign assistance to family planning and reproductive health programs worldwide . That’s the largest allocation in more than a decade – since we last had a Democratic president, I might add.” 
Furthermore, weather modification, or geoengineering , also known as chemtrails , additionally help the slow kill , or fast degeneration of the human species. NASA has admitted to using these weather altering programs, so there is no sense denying their presence. Aside from spraying lithium, strontium , barium, nano aluminum-coated fiberglass [known as CHAFF], radioactive thorium, cadmium, chromium, nickel, desiccated blood, mold spores, yellow fungus, and more, these chemical concoctions act as a global pandemic to further population control. 
Without mention of contaminated food, DARPA contrived control devices, and further attempts to make slaves of the remaining sheeple who live through these demonic efforts, know this; you are swimming in the depopulation agenda. The effects are all around you, and it is high time to put up some kind of resistance.

You cannot make this up…one could almost think an election was nigh… 
The “”markets”” were selling off and the VIX had just crossed into important bear territory when – surprise! – the DOE completely reversed the API report (which reported a larger than expected BUILD) and reported a DRAW. 
Now, I am prone to thinking that nearly all “”markets”” are in full shenanigan mode right now, I confess to that, but that comes from having a lot of context and possibly too much information. 
I knew that a major 400,000 barrel per day pipeline taking oil away from Cushing had broken a few days ago, so I wasn’t surprised to hear of a build. 
Pipeline remains closed following oil spill in Oklahoma 
Updated: 3:50 PM CDT Oct 25, 2016 
(AP) — A Seaway Crude Pipeline Co. pipeline that spilled oil at a storage hub in Oklahoma remained closed Tuesday, according to a spokesman for Houston-based Enterprise Products Partners, a 50 percent owner of Seaway. 
“As of right now we don’t have an estimate of when it will be back up,” as officials are trying to determine the cause of the spill that happened shortly before midnight Sunday in Cushing, spokesman Rick Rainey said. 
CUSHING, Oklahoma – While crews in Cushing continue to clean up oil after a pipeline break early Monday morning, the spill is stoking fears about what may be to come for the nation’s oil hub. 
The Seaway Pipeline is one of the largest in the nation, running 500 miles from Cushing to refineries in Freeport, Texas. Because it’s two pipelines, the owning company Enterprise could shut down one and keep oil flowing, but only 450,000 barrels per day. 
The section of pipe that burst can carry 50,000 barrels of oil or roughly 2.75 million gallons. 
So right on top of the reported build and right on top of a major break in one of the largest oil pipelines carrying crude AWAY from Cushing, what’s a “”market”” manipulating government lackey to do? 
Why report a surprise DRAW, thereby spiking oil, and indeed the entire US equity “”markets” because, such as. 
This all feels about as believable as anything else this (s)election cycle.

by John Rubino 
In June the UK shocked the world – or at least the world’s elites – by voting to pull out of the European Union. Economists predicted disaster, EU leaders threatened pain for British exporters and tourists, and the media settled in to watch the UK shrivel and die. 
Four months later, the appropriate response is a yawn rather than a scream. UK economy set to shrug off Brexit in latest GDP figures…For now 
(CNBC) – The first indications of how the U.K. economy is performing in the aftermath of the Brexit vote will be known this Thursday, with the release of quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) figures.Analysts told CNBC they forecast a 0.4 percent growth in the third quarter of this year – an “upside surprise” following the decision last June to leave the European Union. Prior to the vote, many market observers were pointing to economic contractions if voters opted to leave the EU. 
The pound, however, did fall hard in foreign exchange markets… 
…which is actually great news for British exporters, who are winning round one of the post-Brexit currency war by selling suddenly-much-cheaper stuff to the rest of the world. 
The only losers? Britons who held their savings in local currency and saw the value of their bank accounts fall dramatically. But their solution was actually pretty simple: convert their pounds to gold and watch it soar. 
Britons who did this are up about 25%, which is a pretty good year’s work for any money manager, amateur or professional. 
As the “but in the long run Brexit will still be a disaster” drumbeat gets louder and negotiations with the EU drag on, gold should remain a simple, low-stress way for anyone with pounds to sail through the process unscathed. 
The broader lesson? As the world descends into debt-driven chaos in coming years, the above charts will be replicated in most national currencies, giving all of us chance to learn from the UK’s example.",english,2016-10-26T23:38:51.612+03:00,investmentwatchblog.com,US,68648,"This Is What Gold Does In A Currency Crisis, Brexit Edition",0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Initially it was reported that the bank had “frozen” RT’s accounts, meaning it had impounded the money, but it now says that the accounts have merely been closed, meaning that RT can withdraw its money – provided it then takes it to another bank . NatWest, and the rest of the Royal Bank of Scotland group, are effectively owned by the British government, which acquired the majority share in 2008 to prevent it collapsing. As RT is also state-owned, it has been inferred that this is another form of sanction. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson denies this, but he also denies several of his chidren, several parts of his ancestry and practically everything else he has ever written or been recorded saying. It has also been suggested that this move, which came without warning, was connected with potential fines against the bank for holding money considered “dirty” by association with Russia – though the government fining itself to pay itself seems unlikely. It may therefore be simply a publicity stunt – the UK has to be seen to be acting against Russia as part of the sanctions regime, and may be perfectly happy for RT to take its business to a private UK bank, or even another publicly-owned one, having done its bit of public posturing. However the real reason for this move is not sanctions against the Russian state. It is because a seemingly unimportant event has the potential to shake the foundations of the United Kingdom – and those in the corridors of power have just woken up to it. The closing of RT’s accounts, if it finally happens, may simply be a symbolic gesture, but it may be the precursor to a more serious crisis, which no one thought they would ever see again. The subtext beneath the subtext From October 15-18 Kyril, Patriarch of Moscow, visited the United Kingdom. There is a growing Orthodox diaspora in the UK, as there is in all Western countries, and also a small but well-established British-born Orthodox community and a number of majority British, English-language parishes . However Orthodoxy is still a very small religion there – though figures are hard to come by, no more than 7 % o f the population would curently identify themselves as Orthodox, despite the large Greek Cypriot community which owns the plurality of the UK’s Orthodox churches. The Church of England adheres to a doctrine called Branch Theory – the idea that various different Christian “denominations”, as they call them, are branches of the same basic church. Consequently religious leaders in general are treated with respect, even if people greatly disagree with their faith. When Pope John Paul II visited the UK in 1982 he was treated as a pop star, despite a few insignificant protests by Protestant or far-right groups. No particular fuss is made when leaders of other faiths enter the country from abroad, despite the hysteria surrounding so-called “Muslim hate preachers” who are no more radical than the Bible-bashers who have the greatest objection to them. But how was Patriarch Kyril treated? With respect by those who met him – but not by the media or the political class. When Archbishop Makarios, who had been a politician in public office contrary to the Canons of the Church, visited the UK in the 1970s he was shown entering churches and attracting crowds who cheered him so hard they damaged the buildings. Patriarch Kyril was presented as an apologist for Vladimir Putin and Russia’s alleged actions in Syria, who had been sent on a propaganda mission . The Patriarch was not in the UK to talk politics, and there is no suggestion that he actually did so. The focus of his visit was to finally consecrate the Russian cathedral at Ennismore Gardens, London, a former Anglican church which the Russian church has been using since the 1950s. But the thing which most upset certain commentators was the fact that he was due to have an audience with the Queen, as visiting dignitaries usually do . The implication of the widespread concern about the Queen agreeing to this private meeting was that she was sympathetic to Russia’s position on Syria. The UK has a constitutional monarchy, and consequently the Queen does not dictate government policy. If the Queen has a personal position on anything she will only make it public if she feels her government is making a serious error and will not listen to reason – which has happened only once during her 64-year reign, when she famously let it be known that she felt Margaret Thatcher’s policies were damaging the social fabric of the country. So why should the press and politicians be so outraged about the possibility of Patriarch Kyril giving the Queen opinions she can read on the internet, or in some of the hundreds of letters she receives daily from disgruntled citizens? Because they are trying to disguise the real reason for their fear. It has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with the Orthodox Church, which happens to be the majority religion in Russia. No one minds ordinary citizens taking an interest in Orthodoxy. But the Royal Family? That’s a different question entirely. The invisible heart of the state The Queen is not only a monarch but the head of the Church of England. Though it seems anomalous to others that a church is run by a secular ruler, who could not even be ordained a bishop in that church if she wanted to, this is the way it has been since Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534 so he could get a divorce. The state that became the UK was built on the Anglican faith and the political assumptions that went with that, despite the non-Anglican majorities in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. For three hundred and fifty years the “Catholic Powers” were seen as national enemies in the same way the “Iron Curtain” countries were in the second half of the twentieth century. Consequently each member of the Royal Family is also obliged to uphold the primacy of the Church of England, whether they are religious or not. From time to time, this has created problems. The Abdication Crisis of 1936 was caused by the King of England wanting to marry a twice-divorced woman, which the church considered a no-no at the time . Similarly, Tony Blair only announced his conversion to Roman Catholicism after he had resigned as Prime Minister, because the PM is included in the line of succession to the throne, and could be an atheist but not a Papist in that role. The question of whether the Church of England accepts divorce and remarriage – which is not at all clear cut – has reared its head several times in recent years due to the marital problems of the Royal Family. Prince Charles and Princess Anne have divorced and remarried, each time conducting their second marriages outside the Church of England. If Charles does eventually succeed to the throne, the question of whether he can be head of the Church of England whilst divorced and remarried outside it will come back to the forefront. In 1977 a story went round the press that Charles was about to marry Princess Marie Astrid of Luxembourg. According to sources close to the action a marriage had actually been arranged behind the scenes, but did not proceed because the princess refused to give up her Roman Catholic faith, as she would be obliged to do to marry the future king under the Act of Succession of 1701. However Buckingham Palace responded to the reports by saying that Charles didn’t even know the princess, a ridiculous assertion, as all Europe’s royals are related and attend functions where they meet each other. This demonstrates how deep the fear of rocking the constitutional boat by not supporting the C of E runs . The Queen’s husband, Prince Philip, was born and baptised Orthodox, as a Prince of Greece. He renounced his Faith to marry Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, and regularly attends Anglican services with the rest of the family. However it is an open secret that he has returned to Orthodoxy privately. He is known to make very generous donations to Orthodox churches and causes and is a patron of the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies in Cambridge. Prince Charles also has a longstanding interest in Orthodoxy: amongst other expressions of it, he has refused to join the Freemasons, despite this being expected of members of the British upper class. When the Queen met the Pope on his 1982 visit it caused some comment, but nothing like the controversy provoked by her meeting Patriarch Kyril. If the UK ever started to support Putin’s position on anything it would not be the end of civilization as we know it. If the heir to the throne converted to his father’s ancestral faith, and the link between the state and the Church of England was forcibly broken, it would call the whole political basis of the UK into question. That is a can of worms no one dares open – for which RT is now being made the scapegoat, because no one is prepared to publicly discuss just how big a question this seemingly abstruse point really is. Foreign is the new cancer British banks are entitled to freeze accounts under certain circumstances. If an account contains the proceeds of crime, these can now be impounded by the courts. Similarly it is a criminal offence in the UK, under the Terrorism Act 2000, to provide financial or any other support to terrorists, regardless of what the UK government itself does . Banks are terrified of this law, and interpret it with a strictness which is itself illegal. There have been many instances of ethnic minority commuity organisations being unable to open bank accounts unless they sack their officers and appoint British people, on the grounds that simply by being run by foreigners they might be laundering money for terrorists. So if there is any hint of impropriety about an organisation run by a foreign state, they will naturally review that information to protect themselves. But it is usually the courts who impound the proceeds of crime. The arbitrary closure of RT’s accounts, without explanation, therefore implies that it is being accused of sponsoring terrorism. Theresa May’s response that “ it is for them [the bank] to decide who they offer services to based on their own risk appetite ” suggests that this is exactly what the government wants to accuse it of. Who said anything about risk being the reason, and how does the government know about the decisions the bank makes on individual acco u nts and the reasons for them? So the assumption that this is about Syria suits the narrative we have heard to date. But if so, why now? Has the bank only just become nervous of being fined by its own owners? Is it only now aware of the sanctions regime, or the British government’s position on this conflict? The Church of England, the pillar on which the British state was built, has long had ostensibly good relations with the Orthodox communities in the UK. Many Orthodox parishes worship in former or still-functioning Anglican churches, and successive Archbishops of Canterbury have expressed their respect for Orthodoxy. Until, that is, the Church stops being a weird foreign sect. Then it becomes a threat which has to be dealt with, and always is. In 1988 the head of the Greek Orthodox Church in the UK, Archbishop Methodios, was deposed for “coveting other thrones”, whatever that may mean. It was widely believed that the real reason was because the Church of England objected to him receiving a number of its priests and many ordinary parishioners. He was replaced by Archbishop Gregorios, who began by stating publicly many times that he did not encourage people to convert to the Church he served. A student in Greece wrote a thesis about the deposition of Archbishop Methodios, which the university not only refused to publish but used as an excuse to kick him out of university. The website of the Greek Archdiocese in the UK makes no mention of why Methodios ceased to be bishop, or what he did subsequently, despite the fact he lived another eighteen years as a titular bishop . Now the head of another Orthodox national jurisdiction has visited the UK and been vilified in a way unprecendented for a religious leader since Catholics were allowed back into the country. Rather than being met with protests from angry Britishers, he was received with the traditional courtesy of religious leaders. His potential to destabilise the state does not derive from his connections but from the potential willingness of members of the officially Anglican Royal Family to embrace his Faith. So that Faith must be presented as politically dangerous, its hierarchs as political stooges, to scare people, and their Royal Family, away from it. RT has been inundated with messages of support from UK citizens. Most of these assume that the bank’s decision is politically motivated. Indeed it is – but it is the identity of the UK and its institutions, rather than whether you think Assad is a terrorist, which is the political issue driving it.

И хотя широко анонсированного разведками США и РК шестого ядерного испытания на день основания ТПК 10 августа не случилось, наращивать мощь, делать резкие заявления и готовить санкции это не мешает. Начнем с подготовки санкций, которые могут быть более жёсткими, чем прежние. Об этом 12 октября заявил в ходе встречи с журналистами помощник госсекретаря США Дэниел Рассел. И хотя, отвечая на вопрос о позиции Китая по санкциям, он заявил, что важно непременно достичь прогресса в этом вопросе (что на взгляд автора говорит о том, что прогресса нет), Рассел выразил уверенность, что новый проект санкционной резолюции СБ ООН позволит значительно продвинуться в деле ужесточения давления на Север: важно, чтобы все члены ООН отдельно принимали дополнительные меры для защиты своих интересов от северокорейской угрозы. Таким образом, не надеясь на СБ ООН, Америка делает ставку на односторонние меры. В рамках таковых Палата Представителей Конгресса США инициировала законопроект, направленный на полное перекрытие Пхеньяну доступа к международной финансовой системе. Предполагается вносить в список объектов санкций лица, имеющие отношение к предоставлению Северу средств межбанковского взаимодействия для осуществления различных платежей. Одним из подобных средств, к примеру, является международная система межбанковской передачи информации и совершения платежей SWIFT, которой пользуются около 10 тыс. банков из более чем двухсот стран. Ежедневно через SWIFT проходят более миллиона транзакций. Если Север будет из нее исключён, то это позволит блокировать получение Пхеньяном любых денежных средств, будь то расходы на разработку ядерной программы, оплата за уголь, идущий на экспорт, или перевод денег, заработанных северокорейскими рабочими за рубежом. США работают и над ограничением северокорейского экспорта угля и железной руды. Ежегодный доход Севера от продажи угля составляет 1 млрд долларов, что составляет треть общей суммы северокорейского экспорта. Бóльшая часть угля уходит в Китай, на который Америка пытается давить, заявляя, что ужесточение давления на Север в сотрудничестве с США отвечает интересам Китая (имеется в виду, что северокорейская угроза подогревает интерес РК и Японии к созданию собственного ядерного щита, что не желательно для Пекина). К экономическим санкциям добавляется дипломатическое давление. 21 сентября 2016 г. министры иностранных дел сорока стран-участниц Договора о всеобъемлющем запрещении ядерных испытаний (ДВЗЯИ) призвали Пхеньян свернуть ядерную программу и выполнять международные обязательства в рамках совместного заявления участников шестисторонних переговоров от 2005 года. Как отмечается в заявлении по итогам встречи министров, Север является единственной страной, которая провела в XXI веке ядерные испытания. Впрочем, на той же встрече участники призвали подписать и ратифицировать Договор о всеобъемлющем запрещении ядерных испытаний восемь стран, чьё одобрение необходимо для его вступления в силу. Это КНДР, Китай, Египет, Индия, Иран, Израиль, Пакистан и США. Почти одновременно с этим, 28 сентября, все тот же Рассел заявил, что США призвали страны мира понизить уровень дипломатического и экономического сотрудничества с Пхеньяном, либо отменить намеченные контакты, стремясь добиться максимальной изоляции КНДР от мирового сообщества. По словам Рассела, благодаря усилиям США 75 стран осудили северокорейские ядерные испытания, а некоторые страны отменили запланированные встречи с официальными лицами из КНДР. Пак Кын Хе в своих выступлениях идет дальше – по ее словам, в настоящее время вести диалог с Пхеньяном вообще не имеет смысла. В прошлом, когда шёл диалог, Пхеньян использовал это время для тайной разработки атомного оружия, и потому не стоит повторять ошибки. Сравним подобное с позицией России — 23 сентября в ходе выступления на 71-й сессии Генеральной Ассамблеи ООН министр иностранных дел РФ Сергей Лавров заявил, что Север должен прекратить ядерные испытания и призвал Пхеньян вернуться к режиму денуклеаризации. Однако в то же время Лавров указал на недопустимость использования этой ситуации в качестве предлога для массированной милитаризации Северо-Восточной Азии, развертывания там очередного позиционного района глобальной ПРО США, и отметил, что все заинтересованные стороны должны воздержаться от дальнейшей эскалации напряженности, встать на путь политико-дипломатического урегулирования ядерной проблемы Корейского полуострова через возобновление шестисторонних переговоров. Никуда не девается и бряцание оружием. 26 сентября вооружённые силы РК и США провели учения в Восточном море. Стороны отрабатывали нанесение ударов по наземным объектам КНДР, используя компьютерное моделирование. В манёврах приняли участие три южнокорейских корабля водоизмещением 7600 тонн, подлодка водоизмещением 1200 тонн, противолодочный вертолёт Lynx, патрульный самолёт P-3. С американской стороны участвовали эсминец Spruance водоизмещением 9,5 тыс. тонн и самолёт Р-3. Стороны отрабатывали нанесение ракетных ударов с кораблей, действия по нанесению высокоточных ударов, обнаружению и отслеживанию северокорейских подлодок. С 3 по 21 октября РК, США, Новая Зеландия и НATO проведут на американской авиабазе Эйлсон в штате Аляска совместные военно-воздушные учения Red Flag. В ходе учений будут отрабатываться совместные удары южнокорейских и американских ВВС по ядерным и другим ключевым военным объектам Севера с использованием управляемых авиационных бомб. Южнокорейская сторона направила для участия в учениях шесть истребителей F-15K и два транспортных самолёта C-130 Hercules. ВВС двух стран также отработают оказание огневой поддержки наземным силам и ведение воздушного боя. С 10 октября РК и США начали совместные военно-морские учения Invincible Spirit 2016 с привлечением 10 военных кораблей, включая оснащённые системой раннего обнаружения «Иджис» и атомный авианосец «Рональд Рейган». Крупномасштабные южнокорейско-американские манёвры продолжатся по 15 октября как в Желтом, так и в Японском морях и будут посвящены отработке точечных ударов по важным военным объектам и командным пунктам и уничтожению войск специального назначения противника. Аналогичные учения проводились в июле и ноябре 2010 года после обстрела северокорейской артиллерией острова Ёнпхёндо и потопления сторожевого корабля «Чхонан», и в них принимал участие авианосец «Джордж Вашингтон», но нынешние — еще более масштабны. С Invincible Spirit не стоит путать Invincible Shield. Эти совместные военные маневры ВВС Республики Корея, Великобритании и США впервые проведут с 4 по 10 ноября, и они также будут направлены на отработку авиаударов по ключевым военным объектам Северной Кореи, уничтожение резиденций руководства, а также перехват самолетов противника. Новостью тут является участие Великобритании, которая планирует направить в РК четыре самолета Eurofighter Typhoon, заправщик Voyager и транспортник C-17 Globemaster. Из Германии в РК отправили несколько десятков крылатых ракет «воздух-земля» TAURUS. Эти ракеты предназначены для нанесения высокоточных ударов по защищённым объектам противника. Они способны определять, отслеживать и поражать цели, пробивать 6-метровые бетонные стены бункеров. Об этом 15 октября сообщил представитель оборонного ведомства РК. К 2017 году Германия поэтапно передаст РК 170 ракет. Помимо этого, в связи с недавними северокорейскими ядерными испытаниями и продолжающимися пусками баллистических ракет, было принято решение о приобретении еще дополнительно 90 ракет TAURUS. Между тем расходы на приобретение и установку одной такой ракеты на южнокорейский истребитель обойдется в 2 млрд вон или примерно 1,7 млн долларов. Какова реакция на подобную политику? В случае американских провокаций Пхеньян готов к новым атакам, о чем заявил министр иностранных дел КНДР Ли Ён Хо, выступая перед участниками саммита Движения неприсоединения в Венесуэле. Также Ли Ён Хо сказал, что пятое ядерное испытание было «справедливой мерой для защиты страны от провокаций со стороны США». А что до уламывания Китая, то этому процессу мы посвятим отдельный материал.

The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama’s presidency we’ve witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama’s mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I’ll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack’s tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the “click” extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. “P.J.” Crowley made his “deal with the devil” from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; “Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?” Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley’s credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He’s now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he’s been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. “Fuck the EU”, along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton’s Secretary of State should he reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the “WOW” persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don’t take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the click that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November’s presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed her, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as “hash tag diplimacy.” Her “hot mic” comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being “ridiculous”, they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he’d “fix” the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he’s what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I’m a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby’s contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department’s stance on Russia’s hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won’t End Without Grounding Aircraft – this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington’s plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the “Kirbys” of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby’s “Russians in body bags” threat has pushed the Kremlin’s panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline “U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy”, it did not originate with them. Our new “probably” dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rotschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation’s capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie “The Turman Show” these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since me or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation, Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message – Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause – perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It’s really as simple as all that. Today’s Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone’s time. Once the “Man” has you, he’s got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn’t got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it’s easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary’s Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The “Man” has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people’s fear they’ll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell’s 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn’t that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts. I don’t know how you feel about it, but I feel utterly betrayed.

Here is a look at Jeff Gundlach’s warning and danger for key global markets. 
Here is a portion of what Peter Boockvar wrote today as the world awaits the next round of monetary madness: Yes, markets globally are trading lower after the Apple numbers but we are also seeing another rise in interest rates, especially in Europe. It’s another day of both bonds and stocks trading lower which makes perfect sense as its contra to the last 7 years where bonds and stocks rallied together (and the same trend from 1981 to 2000)…   company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities   
We can continue to analyze earnings and the economic fundamentals every which way to try to figure out where stocks go but let’s be honest, it’s all about where rates go in the monetary world we live in. The German 10 yr bund is up 5 bps to .08% which would be a closing 4 month high. The 10 yr Gilt yield is breaking out by 6 bps to 1.15%, the highest since the day of the UK vote. The French 10 yr yield is up by 5 bps and the Italian 10 yr yield is higher by 6 bps to also a 4 month high. I can’t blame bond weakness in Asia as yields there were little changed. The US 10 yr is getting dragged up to 1.77-1.78%, testing yesterday’s intraday high. The US 2 yr yield is up by 1.5 bps to .87%, the highest since early June on the heels of the weak 2 yr note auction yesterday. 
I’ll reiterate the factors in our bearish case for bonds: 
1) In a bond world dominated by central banks, damaged bank profitability in Japan and Europe has the BoJ and ECB acknowledging their monetary limits with NIRP and curve flattening. 
2) The BoJ and ECB are also running out of bonds to buy. 
3) Starving pension funds, savers and insurance companies of yield is gaining fodder for political pushback against central bankers, especially from politicians in Europe including in the UK. 
4) Mark Carney and Janet Yellen admit that they’re willing to tolerate higher inflation at the same time inflation stats are moving higher. 
5) With core inflation sticky due to gains in services, commodity prices ending their 5 yr bear market (I believe) will continue to shift headline inflation higher in coming months and quarters. CRB raw industrials index is just shy of a 16 month high and energy prices are all up y/o/y. 
6) Atlanta Fed wage growth tracker is at its highest level since January ’09. 
7) Foreigners are aggressive net sellers of US notes and bonds, $180b year to date. 
8) Even without fiscal stimulus, the US budget deficit is expected to gap higher in coming years. Also of importance… 
And here is a portion of today’s note from Art Cashin: Overnight And Overseas – In Asia, markets were a bit mixed. Japan was up a smidge, but Hong Kong and India got dinged smartly. Shanghai saw more moderate losses. 
In Europe, stocks are generally lower as crude continues to trade below $50 and Apple is getting beat up a bit after their earnings report. 
In other assets, the euro rallied a bit against the dollar. Crude trades near $49.25 and gold is down a shade. 
Consensus – The Apple fallout weighs on the equity futures. Crude will be followed closely and could have a big influence if it breaks below $49. If equity selling turns intense, traders will watch the S&P 2130 level. A close below that would trigger the Gundlach warning. 
Stay wary, alert and very, very nimble.

There is a long-standing myth that “soldiers fight for our freedom.” The fraudulent nature of this claim is found, repeatedly, in examples that confirm that soldiers do not even fight for their own freedom, much less that of the rest of us. One finds current evidence for this in the California National Guard having offered reenlistment bonuses up to $15,000 to each of some ten thousand soldiers then serving in the Iraq/Afghanistan war. The soldiers and California Guard contractually agreed to this, but the federal government, some ten years later, is now intervening to demand that the soldiers return such bonuses, on the grounds that the California National Guard did not have the authority to enter into such contracts. Many of the ex-soldiers are now being threatened with foreclosure on the liens the government had put on their homes, lawsuits, or with garnishment of wages, and other remedies sought by the federal government. 
Who are these soldiers to complain? Don’t they know that respect for the inviolability of contracts applies only to “persons” (i.e., to human beings) and that they, along with the rest of us, have been redefined as government “assets,” not self-owning persons? When Tony Snow – then White House press secretary under President George W. Bush – dismissed the deaths of some 2,500 American soldiers as “it’s a number,” and when earlier Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared that the boycott-incurred deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children was acceptable to her, the state was telling us of our status as no more than resources for its ends. 
Readers familiar with Jacques Ellul’s critiques of the “technological imperative,” will see how this dehumanizing premise gets played out, not only on battlefields, but even in more peaceful settings. At a time when the institutional order boasts of the computerized, driverless trucks and cars it is now introducing to American highways, we witness yet another step in the process of helping us turn ourselves into mindless robots, programmed by our Frankenstein masters. Robots have no independent will or sense of being to be respected by arrogant established authorities. Like the aforementioned soldiers, the relationship between ourselves and the corporate-state is no more to be thought of as contractually-based than is our relationship to a family dog or cat 1:09 pm on October 26, 2016",english,2016-10-26T22:07:15.966+03:00,lewrockwell.com,US,26413,Soldiers Getting Stiffed,0,https://www.lewrockwell.com//wp-content/themes/lrc/images/logo-med.png,0,1,0,0,0,bs

In response to “ Such a Nasty Marxist ,” my Canadian friend, David Maharaj, reminds me that repulsive as female feminists are, male ones are even worse. 
I couldn’t agree more. My thanks go out to all you manly men who’ve resisted, defied, mocked, ignored or otherwise trashed the feminists’ toxic agenda. Are you still opening doors for ladies, yielding your seats to them, or standing when they enter the room? Thank you. Are you teaching your sons to treat women with true respect rather than with the brutal “equality” that feminism dictates? Kudos to you. Do you refuse to deny the obvious differences in the sexes despite PC’s orders to the contrary? Bravo! Do you revel in your God-given physical strength, your masculine orientation, your courage, honor, initiative and other male traits? Way to go! Do you love your wife as Christ does His Church, protecting her and your home and children as God designed you to do? May He richly bless you in this difficult task! 
America desperately needs many things: repentance and spiritual revival, love of liberty, rejection of all Marxism. But among our most devastating shortages are manly men who will vanquish the cultural and political nonsense enslaving us.

According to CBS4, they discovered dozens of irregularities during their ongoing investigation such as ballots cast by the deceased and individuals voting twice. CBS4 explains that they have additionally found individuals voting in Colorado as well as other states in the same election cycle, this of course all at a time where the fear of voter fraud weighs heavily in the minds of the American electorate.

Via CBS4 
In six of the new cases, voting records show the same people voting twice in Colorado elections. In another six cases, people are suspected of voting in Colorado and another state during the same election cycle.
“You’d be surprised how often people double vote,“ said Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach. “Two of the cases are serial double voters. I think people discover they can get away with it and keep doing it.”
Kobach says his office is “aggressively prosecuting” double voting cases because it’s a crime that “can’t be caught ahead of time.”

Well folks, it looks like the chickens have finally come home to roost. Karma is a b*tch, ain’t it Hillary? 
Hillary Clinton thought if there was one person in the world that she could trust, it was her “friend” Huma Abedin. 
Thanks to a new drop of emails from Wikileaks, it looks like even Huma has turned on Hillary. Her and John Podest apparently sent a ton of emails right before her campaign started about Hillary Clinton’s brain damage. 
The most damning of all the emails from Huma read: “She (Hillary Clinton) is still not perfect in the head.” Email from Huma Abedin 
The message was sent as a warning to Hillary Clinton’s campaign staffers to stick to the notes since Hillary still couldn’t think clearly. 
Now, I am no doctor, but I’ say if even your closest friends are talking behind your back about you having head problems, that is probably a sign you are sick. Too sick, in fact, to run for president. 
However, I can guarantee you that the second this email got released, Hillary gave the kill order to her media goons to bury this story so deep that it will never see the light of day.

There are so many reasons Americans should not vote for Hillary Clinton, but one of those reasons is this woman’s tyrannical plans to strip us of our Second Amendment rights. What many people do not realize is that if she becomes president, Hillary would ban many of our favorite guns, as revealed in a bombshell report that was just leaked. 
In a recent WikiLeaks dump, we got an inside glimpse into Hillary’s diabolical plans to trample all over our gun rights if she becomes president. If you thought Obama’s tyranny with bypassing Congress and enacting his will via executive orders was obnoxious, it won’t hold a candle to this woman’s plans. She blatantly expressed how she would impose massive gun control through executive fiat in a manner “more aggressive than Obama,” while chipping away at our Second Amendment with a myriad of new regulations and gun laws. 
While Hillary likes to pump us full of crap, claiming that “law-abiding Americans wouldn’t be targeted” with her tyranny, her broad and evasive gun control measures would directly affect Americans with no criminal records, while having zero impact on the behavior of violent criminals. 
One example is Hillary calling for the “reinstatement of the national assault weapons ban and a prohibition on high-capacity magazines.” However, the result of her “assault weapons” ban would essentially take up a massive category of firearms, including the popular AR-15, while making “high capacity” magazines illegal to even possess. 
We all know these types of regulations are completely ineffective in preventing gun violence since criminals have no regard for laws in the first place and are obviously not going to turn over their guns just because Hillary decides to pass a law. 
Her other Constitution-subverting plan is to pass a law making it legal for “victims of gun violence” to sue gun manufacturers, which would quickly bankrupt these companies. However, Hillary’s ultimate goal is to ban all guns in America completely by utilizing the Supreme Court. With her hand-picked justice filling Antonin Scalia’s vacancy, she would have the SCOTUS revisit the District of Columbia v Heller (2008) ruling. If successful, the court would eliminate it’s previous affirmation that it is an individual’s Constitutional right to keep and bear arms. 
When you put all the pieces together, Hillary’s plans for America is nothing short of chilling. History taught us the brutal lesson about what happens when a populace is unarmed — images of corpses from Nazi concentration camps come to mind. Add Hillary’s gun-grabbing plan to her dream of turning America into a borderless society and flooding our country with Muslim refugees, and you have the perfect recipe for disaster. 
God help us if this woman is elected. Continue to share stories like this and tirelessly work to expose this woman before election day. Once she’s in office, the America that we know and love will be drastically transformed into a third-world country crap hole, and Hillary’s life-long plans will be complete.",english,2016-10-26T21:21:57.313+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,LEAKED: Hillary Would Completely BAN The Most Popular Guns In America,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/GUN-BAN-MWN.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

After coming out to the parking lot, a motorist was puzzled to see that there was an unexpected note on his car. However, the situation would soon take a heartbreaking turn when he read what was inside – until he got to the last line, which taught him perhaps the nastiest lesson of his life. 
Although details surrounding the note are unclear, the account was posted to Reddit , along with a corresponding image on Imgur , depicting quite a strange series of events. As it turns out, a man found a note on his car only to realize that it was a devastating story about a stranger’s cancer-stricken grandfather. Stock image of note on car 
As explained in the note, the writer was about 10-years-old at the time his grandmother desperately tried to get her husband to quit smoking. According to the stranger , his grandmother said to his grandfather, “If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you need to stop immediately.” 
The seemingly harsh message apparently had a dramatic and instant effect on his grandfather as he recalls that his eye’s welled up with tears. Sure enough, the man quit that day – but unfortunately, it was too late. 
In a heartbreaking twist, the note details how the writer’s grandfather died just 3 years later of lung cancer, never seeing his grandkids graduate. As if that wasn’t gut-wrenching enough, the note went on as the stranger explained how his mother begged him never to smoke, saying “don’t put your family through what your grandfather put us through.” The note in full (Source: Mirror ) 
Of course, he obliged. However, the note seemed to change in sentiment at that moment, and the writer taught the driver of the car a nasty lesson with the last line of the odd note. “I must say, I feel a slight sense of regret for never having done it because your parking job was so sh*tty that it gave me cancer anyways,” he wrote. “Jesus, f*ck, please learn how to park.” 
You have to admit, this dig was perhaps the most well thought out act of passive aggression that has been seen in quite some time. Although the message came across a bit rough, I think it’s safe to say that this guy won’t be parking outside the lines for quite some time.",english,2016-10-26T21:32:21.566+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"Man Finds Heartbreaking Note On Car, Last Line Teaches Him NASTY Lesson",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/notefeat.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

The family of a Muslim man was celebrating the upcoming wedding of their young patron when they suddenly heard blood-curdling screams coming from his room. When his brother rushed to see where what all the shrieking was about, he stumbled upon a gruesome scene with the groom holding something horrific in his hand. 
Most ancient religions and cultures have a history of arranging marriages and often forcing unwilling participants into betrothals with people they’ve never met and have no desire to wed. However, unlike many other ideologies, Islam rampantly continues to cling to not only arranged marriage but also polygamy, child marriage, and incest. Unlike other religions that have reformed and progressed, there is no hope for Islam, as its most revered prophet commanded and modeled these same barbaric behaviors. 
In a bizarre series of events, a young Muslim man in the United Arab Emirates found himself in an arranged marriage that he found completely insufferable. The 26-year-old refused to take a second wife, a refusal that is uncommon with men in Muslim-majority countries unless the bride is found to be undesirable for reasons including defilement, unsatisfactory appearance, poor financial status, or un-Islamic behavior. Instead, the young man, who has a wife and 2 daughters in another country, found a way to dissolve the betrothal in the most shocking way. 
Feeling that there was no other way to get out of the engagement, the Khaleej Times reports that the unnamed man decided to render himself “unfit” to be married by taking a knife and slicing off his genitals. He surmised that if he is unable to perform his marital duties by consummating their wedding night, his fiance’s family would be convinced to pull their daughter out of the arranged marriage. 
The Muslim groom’s family was adamant that he marry a second wife, somehow forcing the 26-year-old man into a marriage of their own choosing. It was after a family argument that the groom’s brother heard blood-curdling screams and burst into the room to find the man covered in blood and his genitals mutilated. 
The brother immediately rushed the young man to the Al-Kuwaiti Hospital, collecting the severed penis in a plastic bag. Thanks to the brother’s quick thinking, doctors at the nearby Al-Qassimi Hospital accepted the victim as a transferred patient and informed him that they would be able to reattach the organ. 
“I have conducted a number of surgeries on male organs; but this case was very strange and rare as the organ was separated from the body and was brought to us in [a] plastic bag,” Dr. Younis Al-Shamsi added. 
Incredibly, the Muslim man refused the surgery, arguing that he would still be forced to marry the woman after his recovery. After much coaxing, his brother finally convinced him to have his penis surgically reattached. The process took just 3 hours, and the man is expected to make a full recovery. 
The Quran states that men are allowed to take up to 4 wives as long as they provide for them. The latter part of the scripture even encourages Muslim men to marry one of their sex slaves “who their right hand possesses” if they have trouble finding a suitable Muslim woman. Of course, Allah considers women nothing more than property, as the Quran states twice that men should beat their wives if they fear even the slightest disobedience from them. In fact, Allah specifically told Job, a character stolen from Judaism and Christianity, that he must take a tree branch and beat his wife after she mocked him in her grief over the loss of their children. 
Likewise, the Islamic prophet Muhammad proved that this was what Allah intended by beating his own child bride , Aisha, after she caught the pedophile sneaking out of their house in the middle of the night. His reasoning was that his property had left the house without his permission. 
Luckily for the fiance, this man didn’t see her as his next victim with whom he could unload his perverse sexual fantasies and physically torture her if she had any objection. Still, the Islamic oppression of women and children continues to see millions enslaved to abusive predators that are given divine authority to treat them as they wish.",english,2016-10-26T22:01:32.315+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"Family Hears Muslim Groom Scream, Sees ‘Item’ In His Blood-Soaked Hand",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/qazi_meeting_bhatkal.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

A man was pulling out of his driveway when his wheel suddenly got stuck. Initially, he thought he had accidentally driven up on his flower bed, but once he took a closer look, he realized there was a hole in the ground. There was also a ladder in the hole, but nothing could have prepared him for what he’d find when he daringly went down. 
Simon Marks was pulling out of his driveway in Luton, England, when he thought he had accidentally driven into one of his flowerbeds. When he got out to inspect the damage to the flowers, he quickly realized that he had been mistaken. He hadn’t driven onto his flower bed at all. Instead, there was a gaping hole in his driveway. 
Even more unbelievable than the sudden hole that appeared, he also saw that there was a ladder in the hole, where the driveway collapsed. Wanting to know what the odd discovery was all about, he bravely took a look and was shocked to find a two-roomed shelter. Simon Marks next to the air raid shelter (Source: The Sun ) 
“This massive hole appeared. I thought it was a sinkhole or a badly constructed garden,” Simon explained, according to The Sun . “I was just terrified the whole house was going to vanish. I took some pictures and sent them to my dad. When I moved a few of the slabs out of the way, I found a ladder. I got my selfie stick and put it down the hole where I saw two rooms.” 
When his dad Gerald saw the pictures, he instantly knew what it was – an air raid shelter. After looking on the internet for some more information, Simon and his father learned that there were quite a few of these bomb shelters in the area and that this particular one had probably been built after a German bomb landed nearby during World War II. Bottles and newspapers were found inside 
“The previous owner must have known it was there, and when he built the house and put a garden in, he must have filled it in,” he explained. “He clearly wasn’t very worried about it and it just sat there until the hatch fell through. I think it’s great and I want to clear it out and preserve it if it’s structurally sound.” 
The shelter is nearly 10 feet deep and was full of mud. As Simon and Gerald began excavating the shelter with buckets, they found various items along with glass bottles and old newspapers. “It’s incredible to think it has all been made by hand,” Simon admitted. “It’s part of our history so it should be kept.” 
This just goes to prove that you never know when you’ll accidentally stumble on a piece of history hidden in your own backyard or your driveway. I can guarantee that Simon had no idea that his property held a treasure of the past – so you never know what you might stumble on someday and what it could reveal about the history in your area.",english,2016-10-26T22:01:40.151+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"Man’s Collapsed Driveway Reveals Hole & Ladder, Shocked When He Goes Down",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/holeft.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

It’s cringe-worthy enough when a 69-year-old grandmother panders to a bunch of buffoons in any language, but the fact that it was an American woman running for president makes it disgusting. However, let’s look past the idiotic looking birthday cake coming from what is supposed to be an unbiased news source, albeit a Hispanic one. Instead, let’s learn what Hillary said directly to illegal aliens that have so many Americans pissed off today. It’s Hillary pandering at her best, or it’s the worst optic ever, and she should have canceled. “I want to be a really good president for you,” she said in one outtake posted by the show online. “I want to give you every opportunity to be successful in our country.” Clinton announced a free concert Saturday with latin pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. [via Daily Mail ] Did you catch that? Hillary wants to give illegal aliens every opportunity to be successful in our country, and this was an outtake because her campaign wanted none of that talk to get posted online. Hillary is struggling badly with the heavily Cuban areas in Florida, where they routinely vote Republican, and the one thing she needs is Florida. At the end of this one minute video, you can hear Hillary say to Gordo (Fatty), “ You’ll make the difference not just here in Florida , but everywhere.” The Cuban-Americans don’t take kindly to illegal aliens of any race, so where they might watch Univision, they will not like Hillary looking ridiculous, and they will especially not like her encouraging illegal aliens in that message that was supposed to be off the record. Now for the other stupid Hillary moment, which was another bad optic for her. Producer Carlitos gave Hillary an expensive bottle of tequila as Hillary looked all bugged eyed wanting to down a shot. Producer Carlitos led Hillary like a pet pony onto the stage (left), Carlitos gave Hillary tequila (right) The path to Hillary’s White House runs through non-white voters. Think about that. Yes, America is a melting pot, but we want a legal melting pot. Wanting those in America to actually be legal Americans isn’t racist since “illegal” isn’t a race. What Donald Trump said was that it’s okay to be proud to be American. In fact, it’s vital we be proud to be Americans once again — and all races in the United States can and should feel that way. Hillary needs to pander to those minorities who, unlike Cuban-Americans, believe illegal aliens have the same rights in America as Americans . It’s crazy and proves that Hillary cares nothing about America. She is a pure globalist, who is working for those who want open borders everywhere. I truly believe that Americans are smarter than Hillary and her cabal of globalists know. Let those at Univision and those who hate America get this message loud and clear: America is not Hillary’s country to give away. It’s every Americans’ country, and we each have one vote to make sure she can never give our birthright away.",english,2016-10-26T22:19:19.603+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"Hillary’s Bizarre Spanish Birthday Bash, Tells Illegal Aliens SECRET Message",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/composite_14775039478763.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

The closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, who’s attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular “dates” this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. 
Baylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. 
According to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yale’s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didn’t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee’s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. 
Admitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. “I was scared, because they were saying I’m going to blow your head off, I’m going to kill you,” Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. “I’m like wow… seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,” she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror 
With a clear view of at least one intruder’s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale’s music equipment. Although the boyfriend’s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that can’t be replaced. 
“I had just finished my first album as a solo artist,” Yale said. “That’s all lost,” since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It’s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas’ great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.",english,2016-10-26T22:57:28.835+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Girl Horrified At What She Watches Boyfriend Do After He Left FaceTime On,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Yale.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Bill and Hillary Clinton just can’t stay out of the spotlight these days, and the most recent leak about them could be the most damaging yet. As it turns out, someone once close to the duo just came forward to share Bill’s revealing nickname for his wife — but the worse comes as their dirty bedroom habits were exposed. Bill and Hillary Clinton (left), Photoshopped image of Hillary (right) 
It’s no mystery that Bill Clinton is a sexual deviant, but the most recent account given by the woman who had a 3-decade affair with the man is damning, to say the least. According to an exclusive interview given to Mail Online , Dolly Kyle was behind the scene’s long enough to not only know the two’s darkest secrets but even their dirty sexual habits – and now, she’s telling everyone. 
The connection between Dolly and Bill began when she was just 11-years-old. He was about 13-years-old at the time, but Dolly states that there was an immediate attraction, even then. As the years progressed, the two became romantically involved and stayed that way through several of their marriages over the next 30 years. Dolly Kyle (Source: Mail Online ) 
The real affair began in 1974 just after Dolly divorced her first husband, and although Bill wasn’t married yet, he would be within the year. Although she was never interested in sharing the intimate details of the relationship, she states that she snapped when she heard Hillary recently say that all sexual assault victims have the “right to be believed.” 
Knowing full well just what Hillary had done – between the threats and the lies – to the many women who either had an affair with or were sexually assaulted by her husband Bill, Dolly knew she had to do something about it. Unfortunately for Hillary, Dolly is now coming forward with the dirty 2-word nickname Bill husband once called Hillary, among other things. 
According to Mail Online , Bill approached Dolly at their high school’s 35-year reunion to talk about “ the warden ” – a.k.a. Hillary. Saying he was unhappy with his life and marriage, this was the least significant account Dolly had to share. A very unhappy Bill and “the warden” Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) 
In fact, Dolly recalls that Bill mentioned something about having a baby to her. Although she thought he was saying he wanted to have one with her, he was actually talking about Hillary. He wanted to put to bed the rumors that Hillary was a lesbian, even though everyone in their hometown already knew it to be true. 
Dolly states that the worst came when she met Hillary for the first time. “In that moment I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering [body] odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn’t gag when she got in my car,” she said. “The sandal-shod woman with lank, smelly hair stood off to the side and glared at everyone.” Bill and Hillary Clinton (Source: Mail Online ) 
No wonder Bill went elsewhere to fulfill his “sexual addiction,” as Dolly referred to it. After all, what else can you do when you’re married to a stinky woman who doesn’t shower and isn’t attracted to men anyways? Although an affair is never justified, it’s easy to sympathize with Bill on this one. But, I digress. 
The bigger point here is what the two are willing to do in order to remain in power. Most people know that you can’t trust Hillary as far as you can throw her – which isn’t very far – so the fact that she has any supporters is beyond baffling at this point. This woman is corrupt and fake to the core. Let’s just hope all of America wakes up to this reality before it’s too late and she can do any more damage than she already has.",english,2016-10-26T23:13:46.952+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"Insider Leaks Bill’s 2-Word Nickname For Hillary, Exposes Dirty Sex Habits",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/composite_14775063476127.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Social media is buzzing about Donald Trump’s Hollywood star being destroyed in California. However, it seems that the man responsible just came forward by making a video – but his stupid stunt turned around and slapped him big time when he got bad news just a short time later. 
Since the beginning of his campaign, Trump’s Hollywood star in Los Angeles, California has sustained it’s fair share of vandalism. From people spray painting a Nazi swastika on it to literally taking a crap on it, the most recent stunt was far worse than all the rest. 
Seemingly trying to destroy the star for good, a man, who has since been identified as James Otis, used a sledgehammer and pickaxe in order to help him vandalize the well-known emblem. All caught on video by shocked onlookers, Otis could be seen hitting the star with a pickaxe resulting two plates breaking free. 
As it turns out, those plates depicted both the Hollywood star television emblem and the presidential hopeful’s name. Since that point in time, Otis has come forward in order to claim his fame – but it took mere seconds for him to realize that not everything is exactly going according to his poorly thought out plan when he promptly got some bad news. Donald Trump’s star before (left) and after (right) (Source: TMZ ) 
Although the man states that he’s willing to go to jail for his crimes, he may not have actually known what he was getting himself into. According to The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, the plaque is (or was) worth a whopping $30,000, meaning that Otis admitted to a felony. 
Felony vandalism (damaging over $10,000 worth of property) can result in imprisonment for up to three years in state prison and a fine of up to $50,000. Otis stated that he does intend to turn himself in and has already hired a lawyer, but we’ll see just how tough he is when he has to face a judge. 
The tough guy wannabe later added that he “wanted to face Trump in court,” but the idiot must have forgotten that he didn’t destroy Trump’s property, but rather, the state of California’s. Making matters worse for himself, Otis states that he intends to sell the plaques taken from the star on election day, claiming he will donate all the money to Trump’s so-called sexual assault victims. 
Unfortunately for him, the more he talked, the more trouble he got himself into. After all, most people know that selling or buying stolen property is a criminal offense as well. We all know that Hillary Clinton’s voters aren’t the smartest in society, but this guy may just take the cake. Then again, he’ll have plenty of time to think about how dumb he is while he’s pissing his life away behind bars.",english,2016-10-26T23:53:56.256+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,"VIDEO: Idiot Destroys Trump’s Hollywood Star, Gets BAD NEWS Seconds Later",0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/composite_14775128488885.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

There isn’t anything that Hillary Clinton supporters won’t stoop to do or say in order to get their candidate elected. We’ve seen massive amounts of corruption involving every level of Hillary’s minions all the way up to the Chair of the Democratic National Committee. Apparently, nothing is off limits when they’re doing Hillary’s bidding, and now they have a new racket that is going to make criminal voter fraud a whole lot easier. 
Election fraud has already become a big concern again this election cycle as voting machines are reportedly “malfunctioning” and switching votes in favor of Hillary. One Texas county was even forced to abandon the machines altogether and go to paper ballots. 
There has been some progress in protecting the integrity of our elections by implementing voter ID laws, but Democrats have been fighting it tooth and nail. Hillary and her minions claim that it’s racist or oppressive or some crap to expect United States citizens to possess and show picture ID to vote. It’s apparently not a problem, though, to ask them to show ID for a pack of cigarettes or to board a plane or for a hundred other things. Go figure. 
Even as they were whining about how requiring photo identification to vote is oppression, Hillary’s minions were already working on a solution. They knew there was a good chance they would lose the fight against states who wanted to stop dead “Democrats” from voting, and so now, we’re seeing the Hillary supporters’ machine at work. 
Hillary’s minions have taken to the internet to advertise and sell near-perfect replicas of state driver’s licenses. According to an ad on craigslist which has now been removed, the entire purpose of purchasing one of the fake ID’s is specifically to fraudulently vote for Hillary Clinton . 
The text on the ad reads: “ I can provide you with a high-quality fake ID it comes with holographic and also barcode [sic]. This can be used anywhere, we are offering special deals for people who will go to the polls on November 8th, we need to get Hillary in office . We only meet in a public location and accept cash only no trades. All states, cities, and addresses available. Buy 2 get 1 free. Election special free IDs* ( you have no say as to information on these, they are already pre-populated and must be used to vote on Nov. 8th) ” Screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. “ Fake IDs Let’s Get Hillary Elected – $1 (Detroit). “ Lower portion of screenshot captured before removal of Craigslist ad for Fake IDs. “ Fake IDs Let’s Get Hillary Elected – $1 (Detroit). “ Larger view of photo included in the Craigslist ad. selling forged driver’s licenses. “ Fake IDs Let’s Get Hillary Elected – $1 (Detroit) .” Notice how the same face is used to create several IDs from varying states. 
It’s extremely disturbing to hear over and over again about the lengths to which Democrats and Hillary and her minions (including the liberal media) will go in order to try to secure her election as president. Have they no shame, pride, or confidence at all? Maybe they all realize — like the rest of us do — that Hillary really is that awful of a person , in every possible way, and the only chance she has to get into the White House as president is to steal the election . They must know it. Otherwise, why would they try to hard to use fraud and corruption to get her there? 
If true-blue, red-blooded Americans have anything to say about it — and we most certainly do — Hillary ‘Rotten’ Clinton is not moving back in our house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We now know that during the years and even decades that we’ve suspected mass corruption and fraud within the Democrat Party, we were right and we will never be fooled again.",english,2016-10-26T23:53:58.177+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Criminal Minions CAUGHT Pushing Voter Fraud To Get Hillary Elected,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fakeidfp2.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

A sweet 87-year-old man offered a young migrant a ride to the train station, hoping to show him a small act of kindness. However, as soon as they pulled up to his stop, the migrant thug attacked the elderly man, beating him to a bloody pulp and punching a hole in his eye after he made one simple request. 
An elderly Swede saw just how far tolerance and open-mindedness reaches with other cultures after giving a 27-year-old Colombian migrant a ride from Gnosjö to Gislaved. Graciously obliging the Hispanic migrant, the old man and his wife took him 20 minutes away to the local train station. Unfortunately, the pensioner made a nearly fatal mistake when they arrived at their destination. 
According to Fria Tider , the 87-year-old unnamed man pulled up to the station and politely told the migrant that they had arrived at his destination. Simply informing the foreigner that it was time to exit the vehicle apparently sent him into a rage, causing him to brutally beat the driver almost to death. 
Repeatedly punching him in the torso and head at least a dozen times, the migrant beat the old man so badly that he broke his rib and punched a hole in his right eye, damage that was so extensive that doctors worried he would go completely blind even after 3 weeks in the hospital. 
“He can no longer read newspapers or see on television,” according to the court report. “It is unclear if he will ever see again. Before the beating, he was alert and active in the community. Now, he needs the help of four times a day.” 
When police arrested the migrant, whose identity is protected by the liberal Swedish government, he told authorities that his victim had sparked the beating by calling him “little” and a “negro.” It wasn’t long before the thug admitted that he lied about the accusations and simply beat the sweet old man because he knew he’d get away with it. 
The convict laughed during his interrogation, telling police that he was amused that a man just over 5 feet tall could take down a feeble, elderly man a foot taller. “It is what it is,” the migrant heckled. “A man of 6 feet getting knocked out — me leveling a man of 6-feet is really laughable. I cut him down like a tree,” he added, telling police that it doesn’t matter if he’s convicted because “I’ll be on the loose. I will come out soon again. You can’t lock me up for very long,” according to Expressen . Left-leaning Swedish authorities protect the identity of the migrant thug, forcing the media to censor his face and the Colombian flag patch on his jacket. 
Sickeningly enough, the migrant thug was right. Thanks to the politically correct justice system, he received just over 2 years in prison for aggravated assault, a sentence that will likely either be appealed, overturned, or reduced with good behavior. In fact, his appeal is currently being heard by a higher court, which is considering reducing his sentence based because he was located on social media and forced to go into hiding because of his brutal crime. 
Unfortunately, this type of racially-motivated violence is nothing new to Europe. Just over a week ago, Mad World News reported that a group of 5 white men, 3 U.S. citizens and 2 Danes, were approached by 8 to 10 Muslim migrants who asked if they were Americans. When the 3 admitted that they are, the asylum seekers attacked all 5 of them, brutally beating and threatening to kill them with a knife. 
The victims received no help from the Danish government and have been ignored by local authorities. Even the central investigating police headquarters refused to take the case. 
As the elderly Swedish man discovered, it doesn’t matter if you extend tolerance and respect, many of these migrants see Westerners as inferior humans who must be forced to submit. This is exactly what a bleeding-heart liberal found out after volunteering at the Calais “Jungle” camp. 
Last week, Mad World News reported that a 38-year-old female interpreter was helping a male journalist make a documentary about the plight of migrants when a group of 3 Afghan asylum seekers attacked them at knifepoint. One of the migrants raped her while the others restrained the journalist and stole his equipment. 
Those who despise our culture, values, and laws won’t have a change of heart when we show them just how progressive and open-minded our society is. They know this, and it’s the very reason they hate us. In fact, they see our kindness as an opportunity to impose their oppressive and violent values on us without fear of being opposed. After all, we wouldn’t want to be considered racist, would we?",english,2016-10-26T23:54:01.282+03:00,madworldnews.com,US,23040,Migrant Thug Beats 87-Year-Old To Bloody Pulp For Making 1 Simple Request,0,http://madworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/65454645.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

(AP Photo/The Oklahoman, Matt Strasen, File)
Underscoring once again the dangers of America’s unreliable fossil fuel infrastructure, a significant U.S. oil pipeline has been shut down after a leak was reported Monday morning.
Enterprise Products Partners said Monday it had shut its Seaway Crude Pipeline, a 400,000-barrel per day conduit that transports crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma to Gulf coast refineries. The leak occurred Sunday night in an industrial area of Cushing. The company did not provide an estimate of the volume spilled, but said there was no danger to the public.
“Seaway personnel continue to make progress in cleaning up the spill, substantially all of which has been contained in a retention pond at Enbridge’s facility,” the company said in a news release (pdf), explaining that the pipeline is a “50/50 joint venture” between Enterprise and Enbridge Inc. “Vacuum trucks are being used to recover the crude oil and return it to storage tanks on-site.”
“The impacted segment of the legacy pipeline has a capacity of 50,000 barrels,” the release added, “however the actual amount of crude oil released will be significantly less and won’t be determined until recovery efforts are complete.”
The incident comes after another pipeline rupture in Pennsylvania early on Friday, where 55,000 gallons of gasoline poured into the Susquehanna River, and about one month after a major gasoline pipeline run by Colonial Pipeline Co. had to halt pumping for a couple of weeks due to a spill in Alabama .
Meanwhile, UPI reports that “[t]he release from the Seaway pipeline is the second associated with the Cushing storage hub in less than a month. Plains All American Pipeline reported problems with infrastructure from Colorado City [Texas] to Cushing earlier this month.”
Environmentalists, Indigenous people, and energy companies are in the midst of a heated debate over pipeline safety . Water protectors and their allies along the proposed route of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) have been saying for months that the project threatens their right to safe drinking water.
“Oil pipelines break, spill, and leak—it’s not a question of if, it’s a question of where and when,” 13-year-old Anna Lee Rain YellowHammer, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, wrote in a recent appeal.
“With such a high chance that this pipeline will leak,” she wrote of the Enbridge-backed DAPL , “I can only guess that the oil industry keeps pushing for it because it doesn’t care about our health and safety. The industry seems to think our lives are more expendable than others’.”
Indeed, referring to the Cushing leak, one observer tweeted on Monday: “That’s why we’re screaming #NoDAPL ! They always break!”

TTP, TTIP, TISA 
CETA: “‘I trust that an agreement will be reached in the course of today with Belgium, Wallonia and other parts of the country,’ Mr Juncker told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France” [ Business Times ]. “Some two hours of Belgium negotiations broke up without an apparent agreement early Wednesday, following six hours of similar talks the previous evening.” Reading all the Eurocrat statements, it looks to me like “an” agreement, to Juncker, means an agreement to sign the agreement, CETA, at some future date (so that Thursday’s summit with Justin Trudeau can proceed). 
CETA: “What’s Wallonia’s deal? A primer on its role in CETA’s crisis” [ Globe and Mail ]. ” [Walloon Premier Paul Magnette’s] Socialist Party is under growing political pressure within Wallonia, an economically depressed rust-belt region. The Marxist party has been steadily gaining ground in recent polls, pushing the Socialists further to the left on issues such as trade.” There needs to be a left equivalent for “Always Be Closing.” 
CETA: “CETA has bigger problems than not-so-‘tiny’-after-all Wallonia” [ Rabble. ca ]. “[B]y EU standards it is not all that small. Wallonia’s population is 3.5 million, almost a third of the Belgian total of somewhat more than 11 million. There are seven EU countries with smaller populations. Each of the EU’s 28 member states has veto power over CETA. That is how the EU works – on the Three Musketeers principle, one for all and all for one. If one or more of the smaller member states, such as Slovenia or Estonia, or one of the tiny island states with far fewer than a million people, Cyprus or Malta, vetoed the deal, would we be calling them tiny and insignificant?” 
CETA: “Corporate Sovereignty Helps To Bring EU-Canada Trade Deal To Brink Of Collapse” [ TechDirt ]. This looks like what’s on offer to Wallonia: 
The fact that CETA’s ISDS/ICS remains the most problematic area can be seen from a fascinating CETA document (pdf) that was recently leaked. It’s called the “Joint Interpretative Declaration on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union and its Member States,” and is an attempt to offer additional guarantees that are enough to convince Magnette and other CETA skeptics to allow its signing and ratification: 
This interpretative declaration aims to provide a clear and unambiguous statement of what Canada and the European Union and its Member States agreed in a number of CETA provisions that have been the object of public debate and concerns. This includes, in particular, the impact of CETA on the ability of governments to regulate in the public interest, as well as the provisions on investment protection and dispute resolution, and on sustainable development, labour rights and environmental protection. 
The section on Investment Protection is by far the longest, reflecting the seriousness of the problems there. Here’s a key paragraph: CETA clarifies that governments may change their laws, regardless of whether this may negatively affect an investment or investor’s expectations of profits. Furthermore, CETA clarifies that any compensation due to an investor will be based on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor. 
As that demonstrates, there is nothing new in the declaration. Nobody is claiming that CETA will stop governments changing their laws, just that the massive fines that can be imposed by supra-national tribunals are likely to discourage them from doing so. Similarly, claiming that those fines will be “based on an objective determination by the Tribunal and will not be greater than the loss suffered by the investor” simply confirms the untrammelled power of the tribunal to impose whatever fine it thinks is appropriate.

TPP: “If the trade deal comes up during the lame-duck session this fall, the two [Vice Presidents] could play leading roles on opposite sides of the debate: Kaine as a potentially significant “no” vote should the pact come up for a vote while he’s still in the Senate, and Biden as President Barack Obama’s go-to guy for shoring up Senate support and casting the tie-breaking vote if need be” [ Politico ]. 
TPP: “The TPP ‘provides no guarantee of equal rights and remedies to migrants for labor violations, no regional task force or other solution to address region-wide trafficking issue and no region-wide restrictions on abusive behaviors by recruiters who prey on desperate workers simply trying to feed their families,’ Celeste Drake, the AFL-CIO’s trade and globalization specialist, said during a call with reporters. While the broader deal does not contain migrant worker protections advocated by the labor group, Malaysia is obligated through a separate ‘consistency plan’ to undertake certain reforms for protecting migrant workers” [Politico]. Weak-ass framing from the AFL-CIO (no surprise here) and terrible reporting from Politico (ditto). The issue with Malaysia is not “certain reforms to protect migrant workers,” and not even “trafficking.” The issue is slavery , which Obama is enabling in order to get the deal passed. Use the word! 
TPP: “Australia could face a growing number of expensive legal claims from foreign corporations if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) comes into force, a new report has warned” [ Guardian ]. “Dr Kyla Tienhaara, from the Australian National University, said Australia ought to learn from Canada’s experience after it signed the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which came into force in 1994 and led to dozens of legal cases against Canada by US corporations [under ISDS].”

” But Trump’s biggest local political donation [in Chicago] was the $50,000 he donated to Emanuel’s first mayoral campaign” [ Chicago Reader (DG)]. “That donation came on December 23, 2010, a couple months before Rahm was elected. In 2011, Emanuel’s administration approved the god-awful 20-foot-high “T-R-U-M-P” sign that the Donald felt compelled to plaster on his building overlooking the Chicago River. But Mayor Emanuel’s not Trump’s only Democratic pal in town. Trump also hired Alderman Burke’s law firm to handle his tax appeals to Assessor Berrios’s office. Burke then won Trump several million dollars worth of property tax breaks.” There don’t seem to be many degrees of separation between the elites. I suppose that’s why they’re elites…

“Hillary Clinton Promises A More Muscular Foreign Policy As President” [ HuffPo ]. “As secretary of state, Clinton was an early supporter of arming and training members of the Syrian opposition to fight Assad, a plan that faced resistance out of concern that it would be difficult to appropriately vet fighters and ensure that weapons didn’t fall into the hands of extremists. Today, the program is off to a slow start, with only 54 graduates from the first class, several of whom scattered after coming under attack by an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. As commander-in-chief, Clinton would dramatically escalate the program, she said. ” Who was in charge of the training program? Ira Magaziner?

“What Do Trump and Marx Have in Common?” [Jochen Bittner, New York Times ]. This is another piece along the lines of the article from the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal that Yves linked to this morning, although it’s not a piece of outright hackery. For example: “When Hillary Clinton calls half of Mr. Trump’s voters a ‘basket of deplorables,’ she sounds as aloof as Marie Antoinette, telling French subjects who had no bread to ‘eat cake.'” But both articles deploy the “angry populists of left and right” vs. the “sensible center” trope (remember that in the Beltway you should never display anger; it’s a strong taboo). Bittner concludes: “Mrs. Clinton has the chance to change, by leading a political establishment that examines and processes anger instead of merely producing and dismissing it.” Obama destroyed hope by not delivering change. And now Clinton is holding the bag for the anger that caused. From the Department of Schadenfreude…

“But academic research has picked up something that thousands of hours of campaign punditry has missed completely: Donald Trump talks like a woman” [ Politico ]. “Donald Trump is a stunning outlier. His linguistic style is startlingly feminine, so much so that the chasm between Trump and the next most feminine speaker, Ben Carson, is about as great as the difference between Carson and the least feminine candidate, Jim Webb. And Trump earns his ranking not just because he talks a lot about himself or avoids big words (both of which are true); according to Jones, he also shows feminine patterns on the more subtle measures, such as his use of prepositions and articles. The key then is not what Trump talks about—making Mexico pay for the wall or bombing the hell out of ISIL—but rather how he says it.” Readers?

Economists and eminent human rights lawyers alike have this week applauded the British stance on re-settling refugees from the Calais ‘jungle’. Professor Donald Rosarch from the Denver School for Human Rights Law mused ‘We admire the wisdom of western nations with aging populations angrily rejecting cohorts of fit young men and boys, none of whom are likely to be a burden to health services for some thirty or forty years. After their ordeal traveling thousands of miles on foot, sometimes after weeks at sea watching their friends die needlessly, these people somehow retain a remarkable humility and willingness to work. It is a dangerous situation.’ 
Ethel Brantingham from Kettering who eats kippers for breakfast in line with her political beliefs who named her terrier pup ‘Nigel’ reflected the views of the British electorate: ‘We simply cannot tolerate an influx of this sort of attitude, these people have learned nothing about entitlement and the values that made Britain great. Some of them even want to train as teachers or doctors. Imagine them in five years time, raising children and paying taxes in their droves, just as the majority of us were planning a neglected death in an underfunded state nursing home. Boris Johnson was right. Fuck everybody, its all about me.’ Share this story...

In a further blow to the BBC, the hippos swimming in a circle who appear before the BBC news today confirmed they had signed a deal with the National Geographic channel. 
“I know some will see this as a betrayal,” said Edna, spokeshippo for the group. “But you have to realise, the career of a performing hippo isn’t long, and we have to think of our futures.” 
It’s thought their new role will focus less on synchronised swimming and more on traditional hippo behaviours, such as wallowing in mud and gaping angrily at each other in disputes over mating rights and territory. 
“It’s all a bit vulgar, really,” Edna continued. “We’re the best of friends in real life. But it’s what the public want, so what can you do?”

A man is signalling his immediate availability to women by flaunting his Warhammer carrier bag today. 
Simon Williams, 34, is brazenly carrying the bag through his town centre in an ostentatious display of naked sexual availability. 
The bag is understood to contain several large plastic robots which reinforce the visual cues of his readiness to mate. 
The bag is emblazoned with the words “Space Orks W gh”, which any woman will recognise as the cry of a lone wolf seeking his latest conquest. 
“The problem is that women don’t pick up on subtle signals, so I’ve had to break out the big guns,” he told us. 
“I tried wearing a selection of badges on my lapel showing my liking of various campaigning, progressive bands but women just seem to be really unobservant like that.

“But I don’t think they’ll be able to resist this, especially my new set of…Age of Sigmar,” he added whilst licking his lips seductively.

Consultant Jesse Benton of the pro-Trump Great America Super PAC was just caught on camera admitting that he and his associates have been conducting a voter suppression campaign targeting African-Americans and women. 
“In Cleveland, if we can return Hillary to normal turnout levels … we can turn her to regular turnout levels she’s gonna lose about 60,000 votes in that area – that’s dead heat. So we have a voter suppression campaign quite frankly, targeting African-Americans, and sort of suburban moms, just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away.” 
Benton is the same Trump operative who was convicted of purchasing the vote of an Iowa state Senator and was recently busted attempting to funnel $2 million in illegal donations from a Chinese donor who turned out to be an undercover Telegraph reporter. 
The Donald Trump campaign has been accusing anybody who dares to speak against them – the Clinton campaign, the media, polling organizations – of “rigging” the election against them. But time and time again it’s been obvious that the Republican Party has been the one behind the scenes working to disenfranchis e the American voter – especially non-white, male voters . 
Since the Republicans can’t win this game, they have elected to change the rules instead, by passing restrictive voter ID laws that disenfranchise a large number of voters – especially minorities – from exercising their right to vote, closing down polling stations. 
They justify this in an underhanded appeal to “protecting the integrity” of our democracy by waving the imaginary specter of “voter fraud” over the nation’s head. This is an entirely manufactured crisis that does not exist, but has been used to deprive thousands of potential Democratic voters of their rights. The Republican Party is an enemy of American democracy, and we must punish them for it at the ballot box.

The Libertarian vice-presidential nominee, Bill Weld, has accepted that his ticket’s longshot bid for the presidency is doomed, and indirectly demanded that voters give their votes to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton instead. He will remain on the ticket but will solely work towards stopping Trump for the remainder of the election cycle. 
The Libertarian ticket, usually popular with a small margin of voters with a particularly poor understanding of basic economics and the Constitution, were looking like they were going to put up a surprisingly strong performance as Republican nominee Donald Trump dragged the GOP brand into the mud, until a series of inexcusable gaffes by presidential nominee Gary Johnson destroyed what little credibility they had. 
In a statement today, Weld roundly tore into Trump for his unfitness to command and his moral deficiencies . 
“I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. I’m speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. 
Mr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this country’s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable. 
“Throughout this campaign, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an inability to handle criticism or blame well. His first instinct is to lash out at others. When challenged, he often responds as a child might. He makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited the self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States. 
“From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Trump has conjured up enemies. First it was eleven million criminals in our midst, all bent on obtaining the benefits of citizenship, at our expense. Over time, the enemies became any trading partner of the United States. He says they are nothing but foreigners seeking to threaten our livelihoods. Now we have reached the point where his idea of America’s enemies includes almost anyone who talks or looks different from him. The goal of the Trump campaign, from the outset, has been to stir up envy, resentment, and group hatred. 
This is the worst of American politics. I fear for our cohesion as a nation, and for our place in the world, if this man who is unwilling to say he will abide by the result of our national election becomes our President. This is not the time to cast a jocular or feel-good vote for a man whom you may have briefly found entertaining. Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States.” He’s absolutely right. While the inclusion of more political parties into our stagnant two-party system can only be healthy for our democracy, unfortunately this is not the right moment. Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our nation as we know it, and stopping him must be our number one priority.

The Libertarian ticket, usually popular with a small margin of voters with a particularly poor understanding of basic economics and the Constitution, were looking like they were going to put up a surprisingly strong performance as Republican nominee Donald Trump dragged the GOP brand into the mud, until a series of inexcusable gaffes by presidential nominee Gary Johnson destroyed what little credibility they had. 
In a statement today, Weld roundly tore into Trump for his unfitness to command and his moral deficiencies . 
“I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. I’m speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. 
Mr. Trump has some charisma and panache, and intellectual quickness. These qualities can be entertaining. Yet more than charisma, more even than intellectual ability, is required of a serious candidate for this country’s highest office. A serious candidate for the Presidency of the United States must be stable, and Donald Trump is not stable. 
“Throughout this campaign, Mr. Trump has demonstrated an inability to handle criticism or blame well. His first instinct is to lash out at others. When challenged, he often responds as a child might. He makes a sour face, he calls people by insulting names, he waves his arms, he impatiently interrupts. Most families would not allow their children to remain at the dinner table if they behaved as Mr. Trump does. He has not exhibited the self-control, the discipline, or the emotional depth necessary to function credibly as a President of the United States. 
“From the beginning of his campaign, Mr. Trump has conjured up enemies. First it was eleven million criminals in our midst, all bent on obtaining the benefits of citizenship, at our expense. Over time, the enemies became any trading partner of the United States. He says they are nothing but foreigners seeking to threaten our livelihoods. Now we have reached the point where his idea of America’s enemies includes almost anyone who talks or looks different from him. The goal of the Trump campaign, from the outset, has been to stir up envy, resentment, and group hatred. 
This is the worst of American politics. I fear for our cohesion as a nation, and for our place in the world, if this man who is unwilling to say he will abide by the result of our national election becomes our President. This is not the time to cast a jocular or feel-good vote for a man whom you may have briefly found entertaining. Donald Trump should not, cannot, and must not be elected President of the United States.” He’s absolutely right. While the inclusion of more political parties into our stagnant two-party system can only be healthy for our democracy, unfortunately this is not the right moment. Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to our nation as we know it, and stopping him must be our number one priority. This is not the time to throw away a vote on the Libertarian Party.",english,2016-10-26T21:44:01.475+03:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,"The Libertarian Party Just Gave Up On Winning, Endorsed Hillary Over Trump",0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/johnson-1.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

The Obama administration has ordered the Pentagon to immediately cease demanding the repayment of enlistment bonuse s from some 10,000 National Guardsmen who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Defense Finance and Accounting Service argued that the soldiers were not qualified to receive the money or that accounting errors had resulted in improper payments, despite many of them having served multiple tours. 
Soldiers from California have been badgering their Congressional representatives about this issue for two years , but Congress has done nothing to alleviate the Pentagon’s demands that soldiers repay money they were given years ago and have certainly earned by putting their lives and limbs on the line serving American interests abroad. Some $70 million was spent by overzealous recruiters looking to fill their quotas that the Pentagon is now looking to get back. 
“While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not. About 2,000 have been asked, in keeping with the law, to repay erroneous payments. We’re not going to nickel-and-dime them when they get back, and we’re not going to hold service members responsible unfairly for unethical conduct or fraud perpetrated by someone else” said Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. The Obama Administration is now looking to “fast-track” the investigations, which have been dragging on for years. 
However, the Obama administration is still not bowing to bipartisan pressure from Congress to fully forgive the money. 
In a statement, Paul Rieckhoff, founder and CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, applauded the move but says more still needs to be done. 
“This is a good step from the Pentagon. But it is long overdue and far from enough. Thousands of lives have been turned upside down and veterans who have served honorably are now in financial ruin through no fault of their own. While it’s good for them to know recouping has been halted, that does not make them financially whole or address their urgent needs. Many will be stuck waiting for clarity and the results of the investigation until next year. The Pentagon needs to do more than just halt the recouping, it needs to pay them back–with interest.” 
The war against Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) is costing the American taxpayer about $11 million a day . The United States military budget is around $600 billion a year , and the Pentagon has “lost track” of some $8 trillion over the past few decades . We can definitely afford to forgive a measly $70 million in order to ensure the financial security of the brave men and women defend our country and our national interests overseas. To hear the Pentagon cry poverty and try to squeeze money out of our National Guardsmen and women after wasting billions of dollars on projects like the defective F-35 joint-strike fighter jet is appalling.",english,2016-10-26T22:25:40.345+03:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Obama Just Ordered The Pentagon To Stop Making Vets Repay Bonuses,0,http://occupydemocrats.com/wp-content/uploads/trumpvets-2.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

The alt-right’s nastiest bad-boy, Milo Yiannopoulos, has been circulating a false rumor on Facebook about Michael Moore’s longtime support for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, claiming that Michael Moore in Trumpland was a pro-Trump movie. His ill-conceived lie has propelled the progressive filmmaker’s ‘October Surprise’ movie straight to the very top of the iTunes charts with almost 8 million views today, prompting the famed filmmaker to embark on a tweetstorm mocking the Trump supporters for helping shine the spotlight on his film. Righties've doctored clip from my film 2 make it look pro-Trump. 7.9M views! Sending millions 2 iTunes! TrumpLand #1 pic.twitter.com/LHqPO07Va6

Even the Trumps were fooled by the Breitbart writer’s bald lies, as Donald Trump Jr. himself tweeted out links to Moore’s movie, which the New York Times reviewers said was not actually an attack on Trump but is really, “a paean to his opponent in the presidential contest, Hillary Clinton.” Hey everyone – Trump, Jr. & right wing thinks my movie called ""TrumpLand"" is pro-Trump! Haha. Pls don't tell them otherwise! #satire #irony pic.twitter.com/difR93uzTg

Snopes had already busted Milo’s gross misrepresentation, which used audio from Moore’s movie without context or follow through to make it appear as if Moore had endorsed Trump – a charge which Moore has loudly debunked. 
First of all, I make it very clear: I wrote a chapter in my very first book 20 years ago [1996’s Downsize This! ] called “My Forbidden Love for Hillary.” There’s nothing to come around on. I was for Hillary before Hillary was for Hillary. I didn’t go to convert Trump people. I did not want the racists or the crazies in there or we would have never gotten the show done. But we went to union halls and guys that I grew up with — people who normally vote Democrat who are thinking of voting for Trump. That is a huge chunk of the population, especially where I’m from. So I wasn’t there so much to convert them away. I don’t think a lot of them necessarily decided for sure that they were going to vote for him. But I want them to think about the damage they could do by being a legal terrorist on November 8th. 
That didn’t stop Milo from broadcasting this video containing a clip from Moore’s movie which has gotten over 6 million views, but without publishing the entire narrative which explained how a vote for Trump might feel good in the short term like Brexiteers imagined their votes might feel this past summer. Moore’s point is that Trump’s populist rhetoric sounds good, but his economic ideas and 19th century tariffs would be terribly damaging to American business, and ultimately to workers. 
If you keep watching the movie immediately after the part that Milo cited, then you would actually hear this dire warning by Michael Moore about the abject danger of electing the Republican candidate who’d like to end the First Amendment, destroy America’s economy and bring Jim Crow out of the dark past of the deep south and parade him around the entire United States. This is how Moore described the severe buyer’s remorse felt by Brexit voters: 
[Voting for Trump will feel good] for a day. Maybe a week. Possibly a month. And then. Like the Brits, who wanted to send a message, so they voted to leave Europe only to find out that if you vote to leave Europe you, actually have to leave Europe. And now they regret it. All the Ohioans, Pennsylvanians, Michiganders and Wisconsinites of Middle England, right, they all voted to leave and now they regret it. 
And over 4 million of them signed a petition to have a do-over, they want another election, but It’s not going to happen. Because you used the ballot as an anger management tool. And now you’re fucked. And the rest of Europe. They’re like, Bye Felicia. So when the rightfully angry people of Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin find out after a few months in office that President Trump wasn’t going to do a damn thing for them, it will be too late to do anything about it. 
But I get it. You wanted to send a message. You had righteous anger. And justifiable anger. Well, message sent. Goodnight America. You’ve just elected the last president of the United States. 
Once again a simple fact check shows that a widely conservative writer is lying to his audience by taking video out of context to make an argument that is entirely divorced from the actual facts. Michael Moore would never endorse a candidate like Donald Trump or his Republican friends that share his values and lie to America’s working people about their multi-decade campaign to deliver more money to the top 1% of American households at the expense of 99% of our country’s population.",english,2016-10-26T23:39:05.864+03:00,occupydemocrats.com,US,10414,Trump Jr. Thinks Michael Moore Endorsed His Dad.

During the decades-long Cold War the belief in America was that the Soviet Union had an ideology of world domination. Every nationalist movement, such as Vietnam's effort to throw off French colonialism, was misinterpreted as another domino falling to Soviet world conquest. This mistaken American belief persisted despite Stalin's purge of the Trotsky elements that preached world revolution. Stalin declared: ""socialism in one country."" 
As the Soviets did not have the aim that the US attributed to them, the two governments could cooperate in reducing the dangerous tensions that nuclear weapons presented. 
The rise of the American neoconservatives and their doctrine of US world hegemony has given the United States the expansionist ideology formerly attributed to the Soviets. Only this time the expansionist ideology is real. Yet, Russia's foreign minister, Lavrov, said today that ""we [the US and Russia] have no ideological differences which make the Cold War inevitable."" - Advertisement - 
The inability of the Russian government to understand that the neoconservative ideology of US world hegemony is the driving force of US foreign policy leaves Lavrov puzzled at the high level of hostility toward Russia. As Lavrov believes that there are no ideological differences between the two countries, he doesn't understand the hostility. However, he does understand that this hostility toward Russia is a negation of Cold War rules that both countries avoid surprising the other with what could be perceived as a dangerous threat. 
There is no sign that the US government understands the danger in Russia's perception of threat -- or that Washington cares. - Advertisement -",english,2016-10-27T09:02:17.978+03:00,opednews.com,US,61423,Does The Russian Government Have A Reality Disconnect?,0,http://www.globalresearch.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/russia-usa-bomb.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

With just 13 days until election day, CNN’s Dana Bash asked Trump why he is promoting his hotel instead of campaigning in swing states, “I say the following: You have been covering me for the last— long time. I did yesterday eight stops and three major speeches, and I’ve been doing this for weeks straight. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then she goes home and sleeps. And yet you’ll ask me that question. I think that’s a very rude question, to be honest with you.” 
Trump can’t defend why he is wasting precious time promoting his business interests instead of campaigning. Trump doesn’t have a single campaign event scheduled until 7 PM. He has given up a critical day of campaign time to get publicity for his new hotel. 
When Trump got called out for some very unpresidential scheduling priorities, his response was to attack the reporter. 
The Republican nominee is not behaving like a person who is willing to give everything to be elected the next president, and every time he leaves his Fox News bubble, Donald Trump opens his mouth and reminds voters of why he should never be elected president.

Hillary Clinton could probably spend 24 hours a day for the rest of the campaign doing nothing but targeting Trump’s hypocrisies. 
While Trump was trying to drum up business for his struggling new DC hotel, Hillary Clinton was winning more early votes in the state of Florida. There are two competing messages in the media currently about the election. The first message is that Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting. The second message is that a few state polls have shown Trump leading by a little in Florida and gaining ground in New Hampshire. 
It is possible that both of these stories are correct. Democrats are blowing out Republicans in early voting, and with no new sex assault stories dominating the news, some Republicans may be coming back to Trump. 
The important thing for Hillary Clinton and Democrats is not to let up. Democrats are very close to generation defining win, but victory is not sealed yet. More polling will need to be done to see if the two state polls were outliers or if this is a trend, but the polls may not matter. 
If most of the ballots in states like North Carolina and Florida are cast before election day, the polls may end up meaning very little. 
Hillary Clinton is in a great position, but judging from her own remarks, she is still working hard to close the deal on November 8.

""В конце этого года в Крым должна прийти магистральная газовая труба. И с этого момента начнется настоящая, полноценная газификация и электроснабжение уже от собственной генерации: первичный источник — газ. Мы планируем и уже осуществляем строительство электростанции на газе"", — сказал Путин, выступая на организованным ОНФ ""Форуме действий. Крым"" в Ялте. По его словам, ""с этого момента начнется действительно реальная газификация и энергообеспечение всего полуострова, включая Севастополь"". 
Российский лидер также напомнил о том, как прошедшей зимой с Украины на полуостров прекратили поставлять электроэнергию. По его мнению, это было ""преступление против человека"": ""Что касается прекращения подачи воды или вот эта ситуация, связанная с прекращением подачи электроэнергии, — это, конечно, на грани преступления против человека. Взять крупный регион, в котором несколько миллионов человек проживают, и отключить от электроснабжения зимой — это, знаете, очень серьезная вещь"", — сказал глава государства. 
Он подчеркнул, что не понимает, на что рассчитывали те люди, которые отключили энергоснабжение в Крым. 
""Думали, что все встанут на колени и будут просить подачку? Удивительные идиоты"", - сказал Путин. 
Недоумение вызывает и поведение международных правозащитный организаций, которые никак не выразили своего отношения к создавшейся тогда вопиющей ситуации, сказал Владимир Путин. 
""У нас правозащитные организации чего-то воды в рот набрали, язык проглотили и молчат. А на самом деле это же серьезное преступление. А больницы? А дети? А старики? Все молчат, как будто так и надо. Но бог с ними, в конце концов"", — посетовал президент. 
Для исключения подобной ситуации, а именно — обесточивания полуострова, в будущем до конца текущего года в Крым будет проложен магистральный газопровод. 
Кроме того, как рассказывала Правда. Ру, в своем выступлении на форуме ОНФ в Ялте глава государства коснулся и ряда других вопросов. В частности, как заявил президент, до 2020 года Россия потратит более 40 миллиардов рублей на обеспечение Крыма пресной водой. 
""Мы направили на решение этой задачи из федерального бюджета 23 с лишним миллиарда рублей. С 2015 по 2020 г. планируется в федеральной целевой программе по развитию Крыма и Севастополя еще свыше 40 млрд руб."", — сказал Путин. Он также добавил, что эти деньги необходимо израсходовать рационально. ""Федеральные и региональные органы власти эту проблему должны решить и обязательно решат, у меня в этом сомнений нет никаких"". 
Президент также напомнил, что на первых порах проблема с пресной водой на полуострове стояла ""очень остро, особенно после того как наши соседи отключили Крым от Северо-Крымского"".

Не потому что люди глупые или безрукие, совсем не это, а дело в том, что они же не знают, как устроены права и система России"", — сказал Владимир Путин. 
По словам главы государства, просто только на первый взгляд. ""Федеральные начинают пытаться здесь что-то сами делать, значит, они местных условий не знают — это тоже правда. Поэтому вот этот вопрос вхождения, а я об этом сказал, в правовое поле, административное поле России — это оказалось процессом не таким простым, но реально основные вещи мы уже практически преодолели"", — отметил президент. 
Глава государства также призвал активистов ОНФ продолжать мониторинг расходования бюджетных средств. Так он отреагировал на замечание одного из участников форума о том, что за счет средств выделенных на реконструкцию крупного спортивного объекта, можно построить 2,5 тысячи спортивных площадок для развития массового спорта. ""У меня есть встречное предложение. Давайте не будем пересматривать программу, а просто добавим вам денег на эти площадки"", — сказал Путин. 
""Только это нужно сделать таким образом, чтобы средства пошли именно на строительство площадок"", — добавил президент. И призвал активистов ОНФ убедиться, что бюджетные средства пошли именно на те цели, на которые выделяются. 
""Форум действий. Крым"" стал третьим из аналогичных мероприятий, которые в 2016 году проводил Общероссийский народный фронт.

Если отложить реконструкцию одного из них, то на освободившиеся деньги можно построить 2,5 тыс. спортивных площадок для развития массового спорта. Он попросил президента ""пересмотреть назначения"" в пользу таких спортивных площадок. 
В первый день упомянутого форума, 25 октября его работа развернулась на трех тематических площадках: ""Образование и культура как основы национальной идентичности"", ""Качество повседневной жизни"" и ""Честная и эффективная экономика"".

За январь-август 2016 года умерли около 1,27 миллиона человек. ""Это на 21,8 тысячи человек или на 1,7% меньше, чем за соответствующий период 2015 года"", — отметил глава Минтруда. Снижение числа умерших зарегистрировано в 73 регионах. В ряде регионов, включая Республику Алтай, Забайкальский край, Костромскую область, Севастополь, темпы снижения числа умерших составили более 5%. 
С чем связаны такие положительные цифры, Pravda. Ru рассказал ведущий научный сотрудник международной лаборатории политической демографии и макросоциологической динамики ВШЭ, демограф Андрей Коротаев. 
""Главный фактор естественного прироста в эти годы, в эти месяцы этого года, не столько рост рождаемости (он не очень большой), сколько заметное снижение смертности в первые семь месяцев"", — отметил эксперт. Связано это с внедрением — Единой государственной автоматизированной информационной системы (ЕГАИС), которая обеспечила эффективный контроль над продажами алкоголя и резко снизила количество продаваемого нелегального. 
Андрей Коротаев добавил, что в нашей стране официальные продажи выросли, но реальное употребление алкоголя сократилось, потому что алкоголь стал менее доступен. Легальный алкоголь дороже нелегального. Поэтому главный фактор снижения смертности в стране и вообще любого колебания этого показателя принято связывать с алкогольным фактором. ""Благодарим Росалкогольрегулирование"", — объяснил собеседник Pravda. Ru. 
Что касается рождаемости, по мнению демографа, с ней в ближайшее время появятся серьезные проблемы. Всему причина — замораживание материнского капитала — мера абсолютна несвоевременная. Но на данном этапе рождаемость все же растет, на нее влияет региональная политика. В Хабаровске, например, при рождении третьего ребенка полностью погашается размер ипотеки. 
Эксперт Pravda. Ru рассказал, что весь этот позитивный эффект краткосрочен. Стоит готовиться к падению рождаемости и росту смертности. ""ЕГАИС добились заметного снижения смертности, но сейчас, на фоне замораживания акцизов, разговоров про то, чтобы понижать минимальную цену на водку, боюсь, что у нас и смертность начнет расти уже в ближайшее время"", — спрогнозировал демограф Андрей Коротаев.

МИД Венгрии заявил, что российские государственные СМИ описали венгерский бунт как ""погром"" и как первую из ""цветных революций"". Речь идет о сюжете ""Венгры ностальгируют по ""гуляш-социализму"" в программе ""Вести недели"" Дмитрия Киселева, вышедшей в эфир 23 октября. 0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Прокомментировал возникшее недоразумение для Pravda.Ru доктор социологических наук, директор Института междисциплинарных исследований Алексей Новоточинов. 
- Считаете ли вы реакцию Венгрии адекватной? А почему бы нам не вызвать венгерского посла и сказать, что не потерпим, как в венгерских СМИ освещаются итоги ВОВ и ее герои? 
— Мне жалко, что Дмитрий Киселев довольно недальновидно, со странным пафосом полез в очень трогательные и ощутимые сферы все еще довольно сложных отношений между Россией и Венгрией. Вот сейчас венгры вызвали посла, я догадываюсь, какие традиционные слова в этой связи могут сказать. Я квалифицирую их просто, как призыв осмотреться, вдуматься и больше этого не делать. 
Я родом из Курской области Касторенского района деревня Скакун, где венгры в годы войны зверствовали так, что даже немцы не выдерживали такого количества увиденного насилия. Наши отношения сейчас с Венгрией очень ранимые. Каждый позитивный шаг дается с колоссальным трудом. 
Хотя Венгрия сегодня смотрит на наши отношения сквозь призму вероятного экономического проекта АЭС Пакш-2 с надеждой на участие русских в этой работе — создание технопарка, реконструкция будапештского метро. 
Со стороны Венгрии, могу вам смело заявить, я работаю с ними не первый год, это совершенно адекватная венгерская реакция, но она не является угрозой, она является призывом цивилизованно остановиться и помалкивать, потому что иначе мы последнего союзника в Европе потеряем. У нас в Европе нет ни одного союзника такого класса, как венгры. 
И последнее, у меня был идеологический спор с довольно высокопоставленными венгерскими чиновниками, близкими к руководству Венгрии, относительно событий 1956 года. Ну, они выложили свой традиционный набор взаимных упреков, рассказов. А я им сказал в ответ, что радуйтесь, что не я там был, я бы вам там перца задал. 
Я пояснил, в чем заключается трагичность событий 1956 года. Она разделяется на две точки зрения. Вы пытались идти на поводу у американцев, которые подпитывали антикоммунистическую ситуацию изнутри. Андропов же, защищал результаты Второй мировой войны, не давая состояться переделу. Уже тогда было понятно, что вся затея с расширением НАТО на Восток будет тяготеть к проблеме передела Европы по отношению к решениям Тегеранской, Ялтинской и Потсдамской конференций. 
Могу сказать, что сегодня Венгрия ограблена, уничтожены такие идеалы экономических образчиков, как ""Икарус"", фирма ""Глобус"", уничтожена авиационная компания Малев (Malév). Фактически ликвидирована фармацевтическая группировка ""Гедеон Рихтер"" (Gedeon Richter Ltd) и многое-многое другое, что строилось на советские деньги. 
- Но, наверное, когда они будут про ""злодеяния Красной армии"" в СМИ вещать, нам ведь тоже молчать не надо? 
— Око за око всегда, в любом случае. Но не жить по принципу — ""сам дурак"". Что значит злодеяния армии? О каких миролюбивых намерениях мы ведем речь, если кадровая армия должна их молотить 24 часа в сутки. Это было и в 1956 году. Вы хотите, чтобы мы там с цветами и с мороженом ездили? Злодеяния придумали. Нужно четко держаться мысли, что Советский Союз на тот момент жестко защищал результаты Второй мировой войны, нашу победу. Нам навязывали другую точку зрения, которая сейчас вылилась просто в банальное расширение НАТО вплоть до нашей государственной границы. Нас обманули. Нас просто кинули благодаря болтунам типа Хрущева, Горбачева, Ельцина. Если венгры будут это продолжать, в чем я тоже глубоко сомневаюсь, то это будут делать люди, отнюдь не представляющие власть и не представляющие из себя ничего. 
Я думаю, что думающие люди на перспективу не допустят разжигание очередной фазы нервотрепки. Тем более, что можно смело утверждать, что в известной степени подобные вещи субсидируются никак не венграми, а тем же конопатым Соросом. Венгры миролюбиво настроены по отношению к России, с точки зрения живой экономики, социально-экономических отношений и усилению долгосрочных связей. Так что Киселев, что называется, не на ту лошадь сел или ставку сделал не на ту тарелку.

Эксперты Bloomberg уверены: США не будут вводить по-настоящему серьёзные санкции против России. Вашингтон мог бы запретить покупку российских гособлигаций или отключить Россию от системы межбанковских сообщений SWIFT, но это может крайне негативно отразиться на экономике Европы и мира. 
Pravda.Ru обратилась за комментарием подобной смены направления санкционной политики США к первому проректору Финансового университета при правительстве РФ Константину Симонову. 
Пока рано говорить о том, что в США началось некое отрезвление, стоит дождаться новой администрации и посмотреть, какими будут их взгляды, считает эксперт. Нынешнее правительство по-прежнему воспринимает Россию, как противника и оппонента, по-прежнему давит на нас. 
""Надо понимать очевидную вещь: если бы у Соединенных Штатов были бы какие-то реальные возможности по нанесению ущерба нашей экономике, они бы неизбежно их применили "", - отметил Константин Симонов. 
Собеседник Pravda.Ru напомнил, что еще год назад на Западе была следующая концепция: ""Не волнуйтесь, дорогие обыватели, у нас есть секретные приемы против России. Если, грубо говоря, они еще будут наглеть, мы их там прижмем, и им конец"". 
Говорилось о том, что Россию будет отключена от системы SWIFT. ""Это было смешно, я специально поговорил с людьми, которые занимались внешнеэкономической деятельностью до создания SWIFT. SWIFT система уж не такая и старая, торговали раньше без нее, по телексу отправляли платежки"", - поделился эксперт. По сути, SWIFT всегда была секретной кнопкой, на которую невозможно нажать. 
Куда еще расширять санкции? Можно полностью запретить все экономические отношения с Россией, продолжает Константин Симонов. Это, конечно, повлияло бы на российскую экономику. (Глава МИД Великобритании) Борис Джонсон, например, предлагал это. Возникает ответный вопрос: если у вас 42% импорта газа - российский газ, а треть рынка нефти - это российская нефть, то как вы собираетесь существовать без России? 
Надо сказать, что санкции породили антисанкции, которые болезненно воспринимаются европейскими предприятиями. Например, Италия, исторически не раз терпевшая поражение от России, успела пожалеть о введении санкций . ""Я неделю был в Вероне (это одна из самых экономически развитых частей Италии) и встретился с крупным итальянским бизнесменом. Говоря о санкциях, он заявил, что русские нам ничего в жизни плохого не сделали. Это мы к ним пришли с Наполеоном там под Березиной, получили тысячи трупов, потом с Гитлером зачем-то полезли туда и получили десятки тысяч трупов. Никогда у итальянцев к русским не было претензий. Никогда они нам ничего плохого не делали. Зачем мы ввели эти санкции, если теперь не сможем торговать?"", - поделился с Pravda.Ru эксперт. 
Тем не менее мы понимаем, что это скорее локальная, бизнесовая точка зрения. Нельзя сказать, что население Европы в целом сильно страдает от того, что против России применены санкции. Пока что эта точка зрения не является мейнстримной, но все может поменяться, заключил Константин Симонов.

Недостаточно было просто сочинить что-либо; требовалось добиться, чтобы сочиненное появилось в печати, и желательно не один раз, а потом вступить в профессиональный союз. Зато оставаться писателем было задачей довольно легкой — надо было только хранить свой членский билет и получать гонорары. О том, как обстоят дела сейчас , предлагаем вам узнать на примере писателя Александра Тавера. 0 комментариев 0 поделились 
Наоборот, в послесоветские времена стать писателем оказалось весьма легко: достаточно сочинить что-либо и истратить некоторое количество денег, чтобы услужливое издательство опубликовало сочиненное за авторский счет. Зато оставаться писателем стало делом довольно затруднительным, дорогостоящим и неэкономичным. Можно без труда вступить в любой профессиональный союз, которых расплодилось уже около сотни; членские взносы этот союз охотно возьмет, но на этом его полезная автору деятельность, как правило, и завершается. Членский билет такого союза лучше показывать только добрым знакомым — на остальных он никакого впечатления не производит. Гонорары практически не предусмотрены, особенно в периодических изданиях, где обязанности по заполнению страниц любым способом возложены на штатных сотрудников, работающих за зарплату. 
Выгоды писательского положения исчерпались, а расходы и трудности умножились. Короче говоря, если в советское время при встрече с человеком, которого вам отрекомендовали как писателя, возникала мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многое от жизни получает!"", то в наши дни при встрече с таким же писателем возникает мысль: ""О, этот человек, наверное, многим в жизни жертвует"". 
Тем не менее, и в наши дни появляются отважные люди, желающие быть писателями и развлекать людей собственным литературным трудом только за скудные похвалы, без серьезной надежды на материальное поощрение. Интернет предоставляет им громадное поле деятельности. Каждый месяц сотни тысяч авторов наполняют блоги, чаты, форумы и странички в социальных сетях Рунета своими комментариями, новеллами, эссе, письмами и стихами. Тысячи авторов собирают эти случайные наброски в своих компьютерах и систематизируют их в надежде, что они пригодятся еще кому-нибудь, кроме непосредственного адресата. Сотни авторов, устав дожидаться востребованности, обращаются к издателям — и мигом получают на руки драгоценную книгу с собственной фамилией на обложке. И тут у них возникает вопрос: что делать дальше? 
Писатель Александр Тавер пытается найти достойный ответ на этот вопрос. Его книга ""Эскизы"", вполне прилично изданная в твердом переплете, распространяется как в бумажной, так и в электронной версии. Вопреки наивному мнению, будто книги за свой счет издают в основном люди пенсионного возраста, располагающие свободным временем и хотя бы небольшими накопленными средствами, Александр Тавер оказался человеком сравнительно молодым, энергичным и весьма уверенным в себе. Мы разговорились, я вкрался к нему в доверие, и он вручил мне написанную в третьем лице автобиографию, поразившую меня не фактами жизни, — они характерны для многих, а его отношением к собственному стилю. Недаром говорится: ""Стиль — это человек"". Интернет подсказал: эту крылатую фразу произнес французский естествоиспытатель Жорж Луи Леклерк Бюффон, когда его 25 августа 1763 года избрали в члены Французской академии. Ученый тем самым хотел сказать, что стиль есть неповторимая особенность человека, которая отражает его природные свойства, тогда как идеи, развиваемые им, могут быть достоянием многих. 
""Александр Тавер родился в 1977 году в Ярославле, но большую часть жизни прожил в Сибири, куда его семья переехала в начале 80-х. По образованию — прикладной математик. С 2000 года живет в Израиле, где, как и положено новому репатрианту, успел перепробовать целый ряд профессий и даже попытать силы в бизнесе, пока не остановился на профессии программиста. Он не планировал литературной карьеры, но его своеобразный, ироничный и легкий стиль письма неоднократно замечали люди, состоявшие с ним в переписке или читавшие его тексты, вроде заметок для школьных стенгазет. С этого все и началось — с писем. Получатели хранили их годами, перечитывали друзьям, и не раз Александру доводилось слышать: ""Когда ты напишешь книгу?"" Он в ответ лишь посмеивался: ""Да кому это нужно? Посмотрите на писателей и посмотрите на меня. Я рад, что вам нравится, но книга — дело серьезное"". В начале 2000-х он стал одним из множества блоггеров, и история с письмами повторялась: люди хотели больше, но все разговоры о книгах натыкались на тот же ответ: блоггер развлекает мимолетную публику или постоянных подписчиков, куда ему до писателя. Даже мутация блогов, чатов и форумов в социальные сети ничего не изменила. Он продолжал интересно и с юморком описывать забавные случаи из жизни, в том числе и своей собственной, иногда сочиняя что-нибудь забавное ради эпатажа. Гром грянул осенью 2014-го. Особенный гром, слышный только ему, заставивший остановиться и переосмыслить происходящее. Ответ на вопрос ""Кому это нужно?"" был совсем рядом. Его давно окружали сотни читателей, ждавших от него книги. Они говорили об этом открытым текстом на протяжении многих лет. Так пришло решение собрать лучшие из сочинений, подвергнуть, в меру сил, литературной обработке и издать"". 
Александру Таверу повезло, он слышал гром. Я перечитал ""Эскизы"" и никакого грома не услышал. Что ж, по-видимому, и в самом деле это был гром, слышный только ему. И я попытался уточнить некоторые аспекты этого явления природы дополнительными вопросами: 
— Вы полагаете, что написали действительно хорошую книгу? 
— Достаточно хорошую, чтобы быть изданной и найти благодарного читателя. Я могу сколько угодно считать ""Эскизы"" далекими от идеала и втайне стыдиться отдельных откровенно неуклюже написанных абзацев; но факт остается фактом — эту книгу перечитывают и с нетерпением ждут следующей. 
— Вы рассчитываете сделать литературную карьеру? 
— Скорее первые неуверенные шаги к ней. Каковы составляющие литературной карьеры в моем понимании? Быть востребованным читателями? Я достаточно востребован. ""Эскизы"" я выпускал для сотен, а сейчас меня читают тысячи. Писать хорошие книги? Я считаю, что книга хороша, если ее не только читают, но и перечитывают. Меня перечитывают. Обладать хорошим литературным стилем? Вот тут я вынужден в себе усомниться. Я считаю свой слог далеко не идеальным и постоянно над ним работаю. Все-таки писательство — огромная ответственность; не хочется являть пред очи читателя абы что. Само название сборника ""Эскизы"" символизирует для меня некую сделку с совестью. Я знал, что отправляю в редакцию далеко не идеальные тексты, и даже похвала главного редактора и чисто символические правки меня не переубедили. ""Считай, что показываешь людям наброски будущей картины. Просто сделай следующую книгу лучше этой"". И наконец, карьера подразумевает, что литература станет моей профессией. Я так же далек от этого сейчас, как мойщик посуды на кухне далек от поста генерального директора. 
— Что же такое, по-вашему, хорошая книга? 
— Смотря как оценивать качество книги. По тиражу? Но я видел книги, вышедшие тиражом в десятки экземпляров и намного более интересные, чем другие, издававшиеся сотнями тысяч. Может, по долговечности их оценивать? Хороша ли книга лишь потому, что она пережила века? Сомневаюсь. По красоте сюжета? Богатству языка? Жанру? Тут все зависит от индивидуальных предпочтений читателя. Если уж говорить о личных критериях оценки качества книг, то я считаю хорошими те из них, которые мне хочется перечитывать. 
— То есть все книги, которые стоят у вас дома, хорошие? 
— Вовсе нет. Нравится произведение или нет — труд автора я уважаю. Если откладываю книгу, не дочитав, ей всегда найдется место на книжной полке до тех пор, пока она не найдет своего читателя. 
— Имела ли ваша книга коммерческий успех или принесла только убытки? 
— Ни то, ни другое. Расходы на подготовку к изданию, иллюстрирование, создание аудиоверсии и печать первого тиража окупились, однако рекламная кампания издательства оказалась катастрофически провальной. Я потратил на нее больше денег, чем на все остальное вместе взятое, но на сегодняшний день издательство отчиталось ровно об одной продаже. 
— Получается, чтобы стать писателем, достаточно объявить себя таковым и заплатить издательству? 
— Даже менее того. Можно объявить себя писателем, не платя издательству и просто выкладывая тексты в интернет. Это так же легко, как объявить себя гуру или тренером и давать онлайн-советы. Можно представляться кем угодно и создавать видимость успеха в любой области. Интернет все стерпит. Но несоответствие образа действительности рано или поздно проявится. Гораздо важнее, кем тебя на самом деле признают другие. Люди, читавшие мои сочинения, признали меня писателем, как бы скептически я ни относился к такой оценке своего творчества. Когда накопилась некая критическая масса читателей, считающих меня интересным автором, когда у них появилось желание стать обладателями моих книг, я собрал всю свою наглость в кулак и назвался писателем. Разумеется, такое признание льстит моему самолюбию, и я много работаю над тем, чтобы действительно заслуживать это звание. 
— Состоите ли вы в какой-либо писательской организации? Помогают ли такие объединения писателю-новичку? 
— Я настолько новый человек в литературной среде, что еще не успел присоединиться ни к одному профессиональному писательскому союзу. Очень хочется присоединиться к союзу или литобъединению, подходящему мне по духу и открывающимся возможностям. Пока я лишь присматриваюсь к тем немногим, которые удалось найти, слежу за их активностью и мероприятиями. К сожалению, в Рамат-Гане, где я живу, пока не нашел ни одного. Очень надеюсь, что просто плохо искал, и на самом деле они существуют. Просто числиться где-то так же легко, как и объявить себя писателем. Я как автор, остро чувствующий ответственность перед читателем за качество своих произведений, выберу объединение, которое поможет мне профессионально вырасти. 
Живое общение с читателем, безусловно, идет мне на пользу. Не забывайте, что именно благодаря ему я и стал писателем. Как автору, мне всегда интересно выслушивать мнения о своих произведениях и узнавать о впечатлении, которое они производят. Оценки и толкования бывают разными, вплоть до диаметрально противоположных. Критика учит, а похвала вдохновляет на новые свершения.

Форум организован Общероссийским народным фронтом, в мероприятии принимают участие более 350 человек — это активисты ОНФ, федеральные и региональные эксперты Народного фронта, представители исполнительной власти и журналисты. 
Президент напомнил, что Общероссийский народный фронт был первым общественным объединением , которое начало работу в Крыму после проведения референдума о статусе полуострова. И хотя с того времени была проведена большая работа, однако это недостаточно, подчеркнул он. 
Глава государства отметил, что в первую очередь следует сосредоточиться на чувствительных для граждан вопросах — модернизации социальной инфраструктуры, обновлении транспортной сферы, создании новых рабочих мест. И при этом грамотно распределять финансы на реализацию всех проектов. 
""Крайне важно слышать мнение людей, понимать, какие вопросы их больше всего волнуют. Без этого меры по развитию региона не будут в полной мере эффективны"", — подчеркнул глава государства, отметив востребованность механизмов Общероссийского народного фронта. 
""Я надеюсь, что активисты ОНФ продолжат свою работу по мониторингу и анализу наиболее острых проблем, волнующих крымчан, по выработке конкретных предложений по решению проблем"", — сказал Путин. 
По словам главы государства, предыдущие форумы ОНФ (""Форумы действий"" в этом году прошли в Ставрополе и Йошкар-Оле — прим.) показали, что такие мероприятия дают возможность не только обменяться мнениями, но и найти способы решения проблем. 
Отдельно Владимир Путин остановился на преодолении попыток блокады полуострова . 
По его словам, ""в сжатые сроки сняты вопросы энергетической, водной блокады полуострова, хорошими темпами идет строительство транспортного перехода через Керченский пролив"". 
""Рассчитываю, что и подходы к мосту и вся необходимая сопутствующая инфраструктура также будут сданы качественно и в срок"", — добавил он. 
По словам главы государства, в будущем Крымский мост позволит перевозить до 14 миллионов туристов и 13 миллионов транспортных средств в год. 
Инициаторов же блокады российский лидер назвал ""удивительными идиотами"". 
""Думали, что все встанут на колени и будут просить подачку? Удивительные идиоты"", - сказал Путин. 
""Что касается прекращения подачи воды, либо акции, связанной с блэкаутом, прекращением подачи электроэнергии, все это на грани преступления против человека: взять достаточно крупный регион с многомиллионным населением — 2,6 млн человек проживает (в Крыму) — и отключить от электроснабжения зимой"", — сказал глава государства . 
""У нас правозащитные организации что-то воды в рот набрали и язык проглотили и молчат, а на самом деле это серьезное преступление"", — подчеркнул Путин. 
Отдельно президент остановился на проблемах в сфере здравоохранения полуострова. В частности, вопросах информатизации. 
Накануне на одной из тематических площадок форума речь шла о том, что большая часть компьютерного оборудования, закупленного за последние два года для медицинских организаций Крыма и Севастополя, не функционирует, а сотрудники медучреждений не имеют им пользоваться. К тому из-за плохого качества интернета в Крыму не создана единая сеть медучреждений. 
""Если вы считаете, что один из таких вопросов, текущих, но важных — информатизация, мы обязательно над этим не просто подумаем, а мы его в самое ближайшее время начнем более эффективно решать, чем это было до сих пор. Министр (здравоохранения Вероника Скворцова) здесь находится. Я вас прошу мне доложить, какие дополнительные шаги, чтобы эту проблему начать прямо сейчас закрывать"", — сказал президент, отметив также важность строительства новых медицинских центров в Крыму и Севастополе. 
Владимир Путин, общаясь с участниками форума, подчеркнул важность процесса реабилитации коренных народов Крыма. На эти цели в Федеральной программе развития полуострова выделяет десять миллиардов рублей. 
""Прежде всего, речь идет о социально-экономической поддержке, потому что политические вопросы уже решены — это касается языка, культуры, возможности обучения на родном языке, периодических изданий"", — сказал Путин. 
Глава государства отметил, что многие поселки крымских татар находятся в печальном состоянии — там и дороги нужны, и социальные объекты, нет электричества и элементарных удобств. Но этот ресурс, как сказал президент, ограничен и пока что его хватит только на тех представителей коренных народов, которые проживают на полуострове в настоящий момент. Путин обратился к активистам ОНФ следить за тем, насколько ритмично и рационально распределяются эти ресурсы. 
""Любые средства, которые выделяются федерацией или республикой, или Севастополем, должны находится под общественным контролем"", — сказал президент. 
Один из участников форума пригласил главу государства посетить праздник крымских татар в мае. 
""У нас есть такой праздник — Хедерлез. Это наш национальный праздник, он есть только у крымских татар. Я знаю, что вы в 2000 году были в городе Казани на сабантуе. И, пользуясь случаем, хочу вас пригласить на Хедерлез в следующем году в мае месяце. Все крымские татары будут рады вас видеть"", — сказал участник форума. 
""Если в России абсолютно в любом месте скажете, что сегодня сабантуй, все поймут, что праздник. Хедерлез пока так широко не известен, но надеюсь, что это тоже будет достоянием культуры жителей всех народов России.

Most probably, the hottest events will take place on the elections day. According to the first scenario, there are three options of the development. The first one is that Trump wins, however the Democrats will steal votes to claim victory. In case it happens, mass protests, violence, bloodshed and a lot of problems connected with the law may be expected, the Natural News wrote. The second one is that Obama declares results invalid, asserting that the Russians have influenced the voting, which is the most probable outcome of the elections and it will definitely generate unrest. The third one is that the Democrats recognize Trump's victory and agree upon peaceful change of power. However, even in case Obama and Clintons admit their defeat and agree that Donald Trump is the next president, mass riots may spark everywhere. It is noted that Obama can make use of it to declare the martial law and suspend Trump's coming into power, accusing him of all the sins. It is also possible that Clinton wins the elections, but her adversaries will dispute validity of the results. This scenario is quite problematic, as it may face violence which will promptly turn into a military coup or revolt of the armed citizens, a march to Washington and dethronement of the corrupt power regime.

The Germans now try to present the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline as a purely commercial project. The pipeline will be built, despite the anti-Russian hysteria in Poland, Latvia and Ukraine. The economic war with Russia In July 2016, spokesman for the President of Poland Andrzej Duda told the Financial Times (FT), that Duda and Obama were opposed to the construction of the Nord Stream-2. For the US, it goes about the formation of unwanted relations between Russia and the EU, particularly between Russia and Germany. The Americans also hope to push Europe to the construction of LNG terminals (liquefied natural gas) of the American production, of course. Print version Font Size The Americans want to convince Brussels that you the EU must not let Russia build the pipeline system bypassing Ukraine. Such a move would deprive the pro-American Kiev of two billion dollars in annual revenues. On the other hand, several countries of Eastern and Central Europe will remain dependent on Russian supplies for another 30-50 years, even against the backdrop of the ""economic warfare."" Therefore, US officials suggest the EU should start forming an alternative gas transport structure. German companies, for instance, could buy natural gas from Norway, and Italian companies could acquire LNG from Spain. Yet, the Norwegian natural gas will be expensive and even more expensive, whereas Spain will never be able to meet common European demands. Poland says a big, big no to the project on all possible fronts, acting in information, legal and financial fields. Another agent of Washington's influence, Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis said after meeting with his Estonian counterpart in Riga that North Stream-2 did not correspond to common European objectives and energy principles of the European Union. This project is more a geopolitical, rather than an economic one, said Vejonis. Ukraine is very much opposed to the project too, of course. In January, Naftogaz of Ukraine filed a complaint at the European Energy Community, which was then sent to the European Commission. According to Ukraine, the EU may violate its own legislation if the Nord Stream-2 materialises. It goes about the Third Energy Package, which says that the gas producer can not be the owner of the pipeline. All goes well in Germany Germany is quite perplexed as well. Manfred Weber, the leader of the conservative European People's Party in the European Parliament, told Der Spiegel that the possibility to introduce new sanctions against Russia and its leadership must remain on the table. In addition, the Nord Stream-2 will not be built if President Putin does not stop dropping bombs on civilians. German Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier does not hear such calls. On Sunday, he told ARD that new sanctions against Russia would be counterproductive. ""What works in Ukraine, does not have to be a right solution in Syria. We need Russia to achieve peace in Syria,"" the minister said. Steinmeier understands that new sanctions would certainly halt the North Stream-2. The Germans say now on a federal level that this pipeline is purely a commercial project without any geopolitical innuendos, so it is not subject to the sanctions pressure. The pipeline will reduce the price for German consumers by 20 percent, so Germany's concerns are easy to understand. ""Due to the extension of the Nord Stream system, we will provide reliable gas supplies for Germany and the EU for a long period of time. This project will strengthen more than 40 years of our successful cooperation with Gazprom,"" the official website of the Nord Stream-2 says, quoting Klaus Schaefer, BASF CEO. The Germans pretended not to have noticed Poland's failure to register a joint venture of international consortia. A failure to register the project within the scope of the EU means that each applicant will have to independently look for opportunities to contribute to the project. Noteworthy, Gazprom owns a stake of 51 percent stake in the project, while E.ON, Shell, OMV and BASF/Wintershall - ten percent each, and Engie - nine. Director of Nord Stream-2 Public Relations Ulrich Lissek remains positive and sees no technical difficulties. The work on the project goes according to plan, and the system is expected to be launched in late 2019. It is in 2019 when Russia is expected to withdraw from the Ukrainian gas transit system. The capacity of two sections of the Nord Stream will make up about 120 billion cubic meters of gas per year, plus the Turkish Stream - 31.5 billion. This will be enough to replace the capacity of the Ukrainian pipeline, which now supplies about 60 billion cubic meters per year. By 2019, Ukraine will remain only an option for import routes, and Europe understands it.

Selon le ministre iranien de la Défense, le général de brigade Hossein Dehqan, l'objectif de la création et de la propagation du terrorisme et de l'extrémisme dans la région est de protéger le régime israélien. 
Le général Hossein Dehqan, ministre iranien de la Défense, a indiqué, lors d'une réunion du comité stratégique de défense de ce ministère, que la création et l'extension du terrorisme et de l'extrémisme visaient à protéger les intérêts du régime israélien, à maintenir l'instabilité dans la région et à y prolonger la présence des forces d'occupation arrogantes. 
""Les États-Unis et leurs alliés régionaux et internationaux scandent des slogans humanitaires d'un côté, mais de l'autre ils donnent le feu vert aux groupes terroristes tels que Fatah al-Cham (ex-Front al-Nosra), les autorisant ainsi à enfermer les civils dans les zones de combat et à les utiliser comme boucliers humains pour endiguer les opérations antiterroristes de l'armée syrienne, ce qui assure la survie des terroristes,"" a dit le ministre iranien de la Défense. 
""Pourtant, l'une des priorités et des principales préoccupations des commandants du front de la Résistance, est de sauver le peuple et de préparer leur évacuation hors des régions non sécurisées. C'est avec ce même souci qu'ils ont sauvé, d'ores et déjà, la vie de milliers de gens sans défense"", poursuit-il. 
""Dans tout lieu où une opération antiterroriste se dirigeait vers la victoire, les États-Unis et leurs alliés ont recouru à des projets mensongers de cessez-le-feu et procédéà des démarches prétendument pacifistes, dans le but, en fait, de sauver les terroristes, alors qu'au moment où les terroristes commettaient crimes et massacres, ils n'avaient fait qu'observer le silence."", a regretté le général Dehqan. 
""Dès le début de la formation des groupes terroristes takfiristes, la RII avait mis en garde contre les maux inimaginables que causeraient ces derniers en menaçant la sécurité de la région, voire du monde entier. L'ordre de l'Arrogance poursuit toutefois tous ses soutiens à ces groupes extrémistes"", a-t-il rappelé. 
Le ministre iranien de la Défense a exigé alors que l'on mette fin à la crise régionale, ce qui n'est possible, selon le responsable iranien, qu'avec la fin du soutien des États-Unis et de leurs alliés au terrorisme, le rejet du projet de démembrement des pays de la région, la reconnaissance des gouvernements légaux et l'aide à la lutte contre le terrorisme.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani says the European Union can play a significant role in the settlement of the Syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism. 
Larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö in Tehran on Wednesday. 
He said that Iran supports political solutions to crises in the Middle East, including the conflict in Syria, while some extra-regional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches. 
The top Iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world. 
“Unfortunately, military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorism” have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities, Larijani said. 
He also blamed the “extremist and deviated” ideology of Wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region, stressing that neither Sunnis nor Shias support terrorist or extremist acts. 
Elsewhere in his remarks, Larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between Tehran and Helsinki. 
The Finnish official, for his part, called for the further promotion of ties between his country and Iran. 
He also expressed regret about terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria and the lack of a political will to end the conflicts. 
‘Terrorists pose threat to their own countries’ 
Also on Wednesday, the Finnish president met with Chairman of Iran's Expediency Council Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to discuss bilateral ties and regional developments.

In the meeting, Rafsanjani warned about possible threats posed by foreign recruits when they return to their own countries and the subsequent rise of terrorism across the world, and called on the international community to take measures to address the issue. 
The senior Iranian official also raised the alarm over the issue of “state terrorism” pursued by the Zionists. 
Earlier in the day, Finland’s president also met and held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on the developments in the Middle East and the promotion of bilateral ties in different sectors, including economic and banking cooperation.

Syria has dismissed as baseless recent allegations brought against the Damascus government by Western countries in connection with chemical attacks in the war-torn Arab country. 
“The Syrian Arab Republic has repeatedly denied all allegations circulated by some Western circles and their agents about the use of chemical poisonous materials by Syrian sides, like chlorine gas,” during military operations against terrorists, Syria’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official SANA news agency on Wednesday. 
The statement came four days after an international inquiry blamed Syrian government forces for a toxic gas attack in Qminas in northwestern Idlib province on March 16, 2015. 
The accusation was made in the fourth report from the 13-month-long probe by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. 
However, the Syrian Foreign Ministry statement said that there was no ""tangible evidence"" for the inquiry's findings. 
“Syria has repeatedly warned against repercussions of politicizing this issue regarding the credibility of the work of international relevant sides,” the ministry added. 
It also stressed that the Syrian government remains committed to all its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, a multilateral treaty that bans chemical weapons and requires their destruction. 
Daesh has frequently used chemical weapons in both in Syria and Iraq, where the Takfiri terrorist group is mainly active. 
A report by the Syrian-American Medical Society published back in March said that Daesh had carried out more than 160 attacks involving “poisonous or asphyxiating agents, such as sarin, chlorine, and mustard gas” since the beginning of the conflict in Syria. The report added that over 1,490 people had been killed in the chemical attacks.

(AFP photo) 
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has passed a second resolution to endorse the fact that Jerusalem al-Quds is a Muslim city and the so-called Temple Mount is an Islamic site called Haram al-Sharif. The UNESCO adopted the first resolution to reaffirm the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound on October 18. 
John Steppling, author and commentator, told Press TV that the Israeli authorities “have been getting away with the violations of international law for 50 years,” as a result of the US’ all-out support for their crimes. 
“They (the Israeli authorities) pretty much do what they want because the United States protects them,” he added. 
According to the author, “Israel doesn’t care what the UN says, what do they care [about is] that the United States gives them three billion dollars a year in military aid regardless of anything.” 
The analyst also expressed concern about “what will happen once Hillary Clinton becomes president, as she has a very close relationship with Israel, [and] very close relationship with Netanyahu, and Israel may very well feel empowered to take even bolder steps in what has been frankly incremental genocide against Palestinians.” 
The occupied territories have been the scene of increased tensions ever since Israeli forces imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte says he wants US troops out of his country in the next two years, amid rising tensions between Manila and Washington. 
Duterte told an economic forum in the Japanese capital Tokyo on Wednesday that Manila was also willing to scrap defense pacts with Washington if necessary. 
""I want, maybe in the next two years, my country free of the presence of foreign military troops,"" Duterte said in a clear reference to US forces, adding, ""I want them out and if I have to revise or abrogate agreements, executive agreements, I will."" 
Duterte told reporters on Tuesday before leaving for Japan that if he stayed longer, he would not sign the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the United States. 
President Duterte has promised that he would review the defense pact. He has already said that the presence of the US troops in the island of Mindanao could complicate Manila’s operations against the Abu Sayyaf militant group, notorious for different terrorist attacks in the country. 
In a meeting with business leaders in the Chinese capital Beijing last week, Duterte said the Philippines would ""separate"" from the United States and realign with China and Russia.

An earthquake measuring 5.4 on the Richter scale has hit central Italy, including the capital Rome. 
Italy's national geophysics institute said the quake struck at a depth of nine kilometers in the Macerata area of the central region of Marche on Wednesday. 
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) confirmed the magnitude, saying the epicenter was seven kilometers south-southwest of Visso village in Macerata. 
There was no information immediately available about potential casualties or damage caused by the quake, which was felt in the towns of Pescara, Ancone and L'Aquila, which was jolted by a 6.3-magnitude quake in 2009 that killed over 300 people. 
Wednesday’s quake rattled windows and doors in the capital of Rome. 
The quake comes about two months after nearly 300 people were killed as a strong earthquake hit central Italy. 
On August 24, a powerful earthquake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale hit Italy, and almost flattened scores of towns and villages in the central parts.

The Pentagon's plan to launch an offensive against the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group in Syria is only aimed at undermining a successful attempt by the Syrian government and its allies to defeat the terror group, says James Petras, an American political commentator. 
US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told NBC News on Wednesday that the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust Daesh from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror group’s stronghold in the country. 
Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraq’s second largest city is cleared. 
He claimed that US forces won't be directly involved in any of the operations. 
“This is a ploy to have the US in northern Syria,” Petras said, arguing that the US was seeking to undermine international efforts to defeat Daesh in a bid to reinforce its own foothold in the conflict-ridden country. 
“I don’t believe that the attack on Raqqah is a positive move because I think it brings the US closer to its policy of establishing a no-fly zone in northern Syria which will directly affect the efforts of the Syrian government and its allies—Iran and Russia—to defend the country.” 
The analyst noted that Raqqah is a “problem for the Syrian people” and Damascus should be allowed to choose its allies in the battle. 
Petras went on to note that Carter’s remarks bear similarities to US Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s plans for a “conflagration” in the Middle East. 
The ongoing Western efforts in Syria have a different nature. Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. 
Carter’s claim that US ground forces will have no part in the fight against Daesh came at a time when more than 5,000 American soldiers were stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces.

Clashes involving police have erupted in the Sudanese capital Khartoum as hundreds of people demonstrated in protest against the government's land policies. 
The peaceful protest turned violent after riot police fired tear gas canisters at the demonstrators in East Jreif district. 
“Our land belongs to our ancestors and the government wants to give it to investors. We are protesting to save our land,” a protester said, regretting that the government had shown no intention of compensating the land owners in case their property was seized.

Secret peace negotiations between Mozambique's opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama and EU mediators were annulled at the weekend after fighting erupted between the country's army and former rebel fighters, local media say. 
The meeting aimed to contribute to talks that began in May to find a solution to the conflict between the government and Dhlakama’s rebel group turned political party Renamo. 
""We had agreed (with President Filipe Nyusi) that two mediators would come ... to meet me,"" the independent weekly Canal de Mocambique quoted Dhlakama as saying. 
Dhlakama said he had cancelled the meeting after the army increased its presence near the place of the meeting. 
""There was a violent shootout. I even heard explosions from here,"" said Dhlakama, who has been in hiding in the central Gorongosa mountains since October 2015. 
""So I called (chief mediator Mario) Raffaelli to tell him that armed forces had come to ambush me,"" he added. 
Dhlakama quoted the mediator as saying that he was ""convinced"" that the ruling Frelimo party ""wanted to capture me during the meeting."" 
""It is obvious they have a plan to kill me,"" he added. 
Raffaelli declined to comment on the matter but an EU diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that two mediators had gone to Gorongosa for a meeting with the opposition leader. 
The diplomat said Dhlakama had told the mediators to ""turn back at the very last moment."" 
The political situation in Mozambique has been tense for months with Dhlakama refusing to recognize the results of the 2014 elections, where the Frelimo party was declared the winner. The party has been in power since the southern African country’s independence from Portugal in 1975. Dhlakama also threatened to seize power by force in the northern half of the country. 
Renamo and the Frelimo-led government had been engaged in a civil war for 16 years that was brought to an end in 1992. 
Renamo's armed wing has conducted a string of fatal assaults in central Mozambique in recent years as it seeks to increase its share of power. 
On October 19, the warring sides resumed a new round of peace talks despite the killing of an opposition negotiator on October 9. 
The mediators continued separate talks on Tuesday with representatives of each side.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has approved a motion that endorses the right of the Palestinians to the al-Aqsa Mosque compound and slams Israeli provocations around the holy site. 
UNESCO's 21-member World Heritage Committee adopted the resolution in Wednesday's secret ballot at the agency’s headquarters in Paris. 
Ten countries voted for, two against, eight abstained and one was absent in the voting. 
The resolution expresses UNESCO’s deep concerns over Israeli construction works and archaeological excavations in the Old City of Jerusalem al-Quds. 
Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, welcomed the passage of the motion and accused the Tel Aviv regime of resorting to a campaign of distorting facts in a bid to legitimize its occupation of East Jerusalem al-Quds. 
“Through an orchestrated campaign, Israel has been using archaeological claims and distortion of facts as a way to legitimize the annexation of occupied East Jerusalem,” Erekat said. 
He further noted that the UNESCO resolution urges “respecting the status quo of its religious sites, including the al-Aqsa Mosque compound that continues to be threatened by the systematic incitement and provocative actions of the Israeli government and extremist Jewish groups.” 
Earlier this month, UNESCO’s 58-member Executive Board approved a similar resolution, prompting a furious reaction from Israel as the regime suspended its ties with the agency. 
Wednesday’s vote further infuriated Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that the regime’s ambassador to UNESCO, Carmel Shama-Hacohen, had been recalled for consultations. 
""We will decide what the next steps will be,” Netanyahu said in a statement. 
Elias Sanbar, Palestine’s UNESCO envoy, fired back at those upset with the resolution and warned that Israelis were “politicizing religion and this is very dangerous."" 
Makram Mustafa Queisi, Jordan’s ambassador to UNESCO, also stressed that UNESCO tried to tackle the issue from a “technical point of view” while many parties were politicizing it.

Palestine became the 195th full member of UNESCO in October 2011, triggering a cut in Tel Aviv’s funding to the agency. 
The occupied territories have already been the scene of increased tensions ever since the Israeli regime imposed restrictions on the entry of Palestinian worshipers into the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in August 2015. 
More than 250 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of last October.

British Defense Minister Michael Fallon says the UK is set to deploy hundreds of troops to the Baltic region in Europe to support its NATO allies in the face of a “more assertive Russia.” 
Fallon told a NATO ministerial meeting in Brussels on Wednesday that Britain would send 800 soldiers to Estonia to fulfill its pledge to deliver one of four battalions to NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence in Eastern Europe. 
“Backed by a rising defense budget, this deployment of air, land and sea forces shows that we will continue to play a leading role in NATO, supporting the defense and security of our allies from the north to the south of the alliance,” Fallon said. 
NATO had announced in July that it would deploy, on a rotational basis, four multinational battalions to Poland and the Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania—to deter what it referred to as “any Russian incursion.” 
During his address at the meeting, Fallon also said that four British Typhoon fighter jets would be dispatched to Romania under the NATO Southern Air Policing mission, which is supposed to protect the Baltic states' airspace against possible attacks from Russia. 
“This is about two things: reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence,” Fallon had said in an earlier interview. “This is not simply a trip-wire….This is a serious military presence.” 
The move is likely to draw criticism from Moscow, which has been angered by NATO’s military buildup on its Western borders. 
The US-led military alliance cut its ties with Moscow in 2014 and has been reinforcing its presence near Russia’s borders ever since. 
The UK and Russia have strong disagreements over a number of issues, mainly the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. 
The two countries’ military forces have been involved in a series of aerial and naval confrontations, with Britain sending its jets and warships on several occasions to intercept Russian bombers and naval fleets. 
The latest of those encounters occurred on Thursday, when the Russian aircraft career Admiral Kuznetsov and its seven-ship task force were “shadowed” by two British warships on a course to sail through the North Sea and English Channel, on their way to Syria.

Pakistan’s army says Indian troops have killed two civilians in the disputed region of Kashmir. 
A military statement said on Wednesday that “unprovoked” firing by the Indian forces took place along the “working boundary,” which separates Pakistan’s Punjab province from Indian-controlled Kashmir. 
The two were killed in the village of Chaprar, the statement said, adding that ""eight civilians were also injured by the Indian fire."" 
Separately, a Pakistani civilian who was injured due to an earlier cross-border shelling succumbed to injuries on Wednesday. 
The Pakistani military said, ""Another civilian... who was injured by the Indian firing at Line of Control (LoC) Monday (October 24), succumbed to injuries today."" 
Tensions have been running high along the Line of Control, which divides the two neighbors in Kashmir. Pakistani villagers show the wall of a house damaged by heavy mortar shells fired by Indian troops in the border village of Chaprar on October 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
The Pakistani Foreign Ministry summoned a senior Indian diplomat to lodge a protest ""over the unprovoked firing by India on the LoC and the working boundary on October 25 and 26."" 
The ministry called on India to ""instruct its troops to respect the ceasefire"" and ""refrain from intentionally targeting the villages and maintain peace."" 
Relations between the two countries have plummeted in recent months, with India blaming Pakistan for a raid on an army base in Indian-controlled Kashmir in September that killed 19 soldiers. New Delhi responded with what it called ""surgical strikes,"" infuriating Islamabad. 
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan but claimed in full by both since the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947. 
India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire in Kashmir on November 26, 2003, and launched a peace process the following year. Since then, there have been sporadic clashes, with the two sides trading accusations of violating the ceasefire along their de facto border.

(AFP photo) 
James Clapper, the US director of national intelligence, has warned that the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could prompt Russia to shoot down US planes. This comes as Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the 2016 US presidential election, has called for establishing a no-fly zone in the Arab country. Russia has recently deployed mobile S-400 and S-300 missile batteries to western Syria, which are ready to shoot down cruise missiles and aircraft. 
Gordon Duff, a senior editor with the Veterans Today, told Press TV that James Clapper who spoke out against former secretary of state’s emphasis on a no-fly zone over Syria is responsible, because the American officials obtain their intelligence on the Syrian conflict from the spy chief. 
“The public position of the United States vis-à-vis Syria was established based on intelligence supplied exclusively by James Clapper,” Duff noted, adding, “He (Clapper) is the one that talks about the gas, he’s the one who talks about the barrel bombs, [and] everything that’s been disproven.” 
He said, “Every crazy scheme that the US comes up with to blame Syria for killing its own people or the Russians for slaughtering people in hospitals, it all comes from James Clapper, the director of the National Intelligence Agency, who fed that information to Secretary Clinton, who fed that information to President [Barack] Obama.” 
“Clinton said that she favored a no-fly zone only if acceptable for both Russia and Damascus and after negotiations,” which is a very different story than the one said by the spy chief for political purposes, Duff said. 
Duff added that the imposition of “no-fly zone obviously is going to help no one but al-Nusra [Front] and ISIS (Daesh)” terrorists. 
Damascus and Moscow carry out airstrikes against terrorist groups who wreak havoc in the Arab country, but the US and its allies push for imposing a no-fly zone on Syria to pursue their agenda in the war-ridden state. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been gripped with foreign-backed militancy, which has left hundreds of thousands of people dead or wounded and millions of others homeless.

Clashes have erupted outside South Africa's parliament as police struggled to disperse students protesting against financial hardships and the deteriorating economic situation in the country. 
The protest on Wednesday outside the national assembly building in Cape Town saw a direct confrontation between the police and about 2,000 students. 
The protesting students were mainly angry at the increased tuition fees in the universities. They also voiced anger at South Africa’s grim economic prospects. 
Other cities across the country have seen similar protests over the past weeks, some of them violent. Officials in Cape Town, Johannesburg and elsewhere have even ordered the temporary closure of the universities to calm down the situation. An injured student is helped by classmates during a protest outside the parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, October 26, 2016. (Photo by Reuters) 
The clashes on Wednesday came as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan delivered a speech in the parliament to warn about South Africa’s weakening economy, although he vowed that the government would do anything to help students in the country cope with financial problems. 
“We will do everything that is possible to regain normality on our campuses. We want the violence to stop,” Gordhan said, adding, “Many students face financial hardships that undermine their ability to succeed academically.” 
Gordhan said South Africa’s 2016 growth forecast stood at 0.5 percent. He also stated that an extra 17 billion rand ($1.2 billion) would be earmarked for funding university students. 
He warned that a growing sense of political uncertainty in South Africa could seriously harm the country’s financial position in the world. 
“Much more disturbing, and more difficult, is the rise in our own communities of anger and discontent, spilling over into violence and destructive protests,” Gordhan said, adding, “It is not just that our economic outlook is distressed, and there is the possibility of downgrades in credit ratings.” 
Gordhan’s promise of spending cuts and fighting corruption has triggered a new political stand-off in South Africa. He has been ordered to appear in court on November 2 to face charges of fraud in what many see as a direct clash between him and people loyal to President Jacob Zuma. The minister enjoys a good deal of public support over his record in office. 
Some senior members of Zuma’s African National Congress (ANC) have dismissed charges against Gordhan as politically motivated, calling on Zuma and the ANC’s senior figures to resign to save the party from the current political turmoil.

The leader of Yemen’s Houthi Ansarullah movement says Saudi Arabia commits crimes across the globe with the US green light. 
Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said on Wednesday that the Al Saud family has adopted a hypocritical approach in the Muslim world, the proof of which is Takfiri violence gripping the region. 
""When Washington gives the Riyadh regime the green light, sedition sparks in all countries, with the Saudi offensive being in line with such a trend,"" he added. 
The Houthi leader also warned that Saudi Arabia is seeking to damage security in some Arab countries such as Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Iraq through petrodollars and deceptive propaganda works. 
Instead of countering the enemies of Islam, including the US and Israel, the kingdom has been engaged in spreading Takfiri ideology and arming terrorists, Houthi noted. 
'Saudi has Yemenis’ blood on its hands' 
On October 8, in one of the deadliest attacks Yemen, Saudi warplanes bombarded a funeral hall packed with mourners in Sana’a, killing over 140 people and injuring at least 525 others. 
Human Rights Watch, a New York-based rights group, said that the Sana’a bombing constitutes an apparent war crime, while Amnesty International said the attack was a reminder of the need for the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. People inspect the aftermath of a Saudi airstrike in Sana’a, Yemen, October 8, 2016. (Photo by AP) 
Saudi Arabia committed crimes by the Sana’a attack, but it tried to acquit itself of the assault, Houthi said, adding that there was no clear sign suggesting an end to the Saudi offensive. 
He also stressed that Yemenis cannot rely on the United Nations as the world body has not adopted a position regarding the Saudi attack in Sana’a. 
Houthi further wished victory for the Palestinian nation and the resistance front in Lebanon and Syria as well as the Iraqi people in their anti-terror operation in the city of Mosul. 
The Riyadh regime resumed its deadly airstrikes on Yemen on Sunday hours after a three-day truce in the conflict-ridden country expired. 
Yemen has seen almost daily military attacks by Saudi Arabia since late March 2015, with the UN putting the toll from the aggression at more than 10,000. 
The offensive was launched to crush the Houthi Ansarullah movement and its allies and reinstate the former Yemeni government.

The UN refugee agency, also known as the UNHCR, says the number of refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea on their way to Europe in 2016 has reached an all-time high. 
""We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded,"" said the UN refugee agency spokesman, William Spindler, on Wednesday. 
The alarming surge, which surpassed the death toll of 3,771 for 2015, comes despite a considerable decline in the number of refugees crossing the Mediterranean in 2016. 
More than a million people reached Europe via the Mediterranean in 2016, while fewer than 330,000 crossings have been reported so far this year. 
The number of refugees heading to Europe has declined as the European Union in March signed a controversial deal with Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of refugees into the continent by forcing those deported from the EU to either be located in Turkey or go back to the original country of departure. 
Since then, the route between Libya and Italy across the central Mediterranean has become the main way as pathways to Greece have been closed down. 
According to the agency, the likelihood of perishing in the shorter route between Turkey and Greece was one in 88, while one death for every 47 arrivals was reported in the most perilous route between Libya and Italy in 2016. 
The UNHCR attributed the surge mainly to the overcrowded “lower quality vessels, flimsy inflatable rafts” often used by smugglers. In this October 21, 2016 photo provided by Sea-Watch aid group refugees sit in an inflatable boat off the Libyan coast in the Mediterranean Sea. (Via AP) 
25 refugees found dead in Mediterranean Sea, MSF says 
Earlier on Wednesday, Doctors Without Borders, known as the MSF by its French acronym, said 25 bodies had been retrieved from a refugee boat during a rescue operation in the Mediterranean. 
The MSF said its ship, Bourbon Argos, found the bodies aboard the vessel 26 nautical miles off Libya late on Tuesday. The vessel was carrying 107 survivors. The victims had apparently been burned, suffocated or drowned. 
The recovery operation, which took place with the help of a team from the Berlin-based non-governmental organization Sea-Watch, took a long time as the boat was flooded with a mixture of fuel and seawater. 
""The mixture of water and fuel was so foul that we could not stay on the boat for long periods. It was horrible,"" said Michele Telaro, the MSF project leader. 
The MSF also saved 139 people aboard another dinghy on Tuesday. Sea-Watch recovered a body in another operation. 
The Italian Coast Guard reported that 500 refugees were rescued from overcrowded boats on Tuesday. 
Most of the asylum seekers that have triggered the unprecedented influx of refugees Europe has been dealing with over the past few years flee conflict-ridden zones in North Africa and the Middle East, particularly Syria. Many blame Western policies toward the conflicts for the refugee crisis.

US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter says the Pentagon is planning a ground offensive to oust the Daesh (ISIL) terrorist group from the Syrian city of Raqqah, the terror group’s stronghold in the country. 
Speaking to NBC News on Wednesday, Carter said Washington was ready to equip Syrian and Kurdish fighters to launch the assault in the near future. 
“It starts in the next few weeks, hat has long been our plan and we will be capable of resourcing both [groups],” the Pentagon chief noted. 
Carter, who was in Iraq earlier this week amid the ongoing battle to retake the city of Mosul from Daesh, said the Raqqah offensive would begin when Iraq’s second largest city is cleared. 
The Iraqi army, backed by volunteer forces, has been engaged in a large military offensive to cleanse Mosul of Daesh terrorists since last week. A coalition of US-led countries has been reportedly providing air support to the operation. 
“It's been long a part of our plan that the Mosul operation would kick off when it did. This was a plan that goes back many months now and that Raqqah would follow soon behind,” Carter added. Iraqi forces gather in the al-Shura area, south of Mosul, October 24, 2016. (Photo by AFP) 
Carter acknowledged that US forces won't be directly involved in any of the operations. 
More than 5,000 American soldiers are currently stationed in Iraq, tasked with providing training and intelligence to Iraqi forces, according to US military officials. 
The US-led coalition has also been carrying out airstrikes against purported Daesh positions in Syria since 2014. 
However, the ongoing Western efforts in Syria have a different nature. Washington and its allies have come under fire for openly seeking to remove President Bashar al-Assad from power. 
Amnesty International, a UK-based rights group, said Wednesday that the US-led airstrikes have killed hundreds of civilians across Syria. 
Carter’s remarks came only a day after British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said UK special forces will soon resume training “moderate” militants in Syria to bolster the fight against Daesh. 
The new effort would be an extension of a failed $500 million program by the Pentagon that was supposed to “train and equip” up to 5,000 militants every year, but was discontinued in November last year, after failing to attract enough volunteers.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif will pay an official one-day visit to Russia for talks on the Syrian crisis. 
Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Bahram Qassemi said on Wednesday that the top diplomat is due in Moscow on Friday. 
He said that Zarif is scheduled to attend a trilateral meeting with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem on regional developments, including the conflict in Syria. 
According to Qassemi, Zarif will also hold a separate meeting with Lavrov to discuss Tehran-Moscow relations. 
Meanwhile, Russia's RIA news agency, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry, reported that Zarif and Lavrov will also discuss the situation in Iraq. 
Muallem's scheduled visit on Friday had earlier been announced by the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
Iran and Russia have similar stances on the ongoing deadly crisis in Syria. Moscow and Tehran reject any foreign interference in the affairs of the war-hit country, stressing that only the Syrians are entitled to decide their own fate. 
Iran has been providing military advisory assistance to the Syrian government in its campaign against terrorism. 
Russia has also been carrying out airstrikes against terrorists' positions in Syria since September last year at the official request of the Damascus government. 
Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Over 400,000 people have so far been killed in the conflict, according to estimates by UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura . 
In neighboring Iraq, the Arab country’s army is also pressing ahead with a massive operation aimed at recapturing Mosul from Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who captured the strategic city in June 2014.

Egypt's Appeals Court has upheld a draconian life sentence that was handed down to Mohammed Badie, the spiritual leader of the now outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. 
The court ruled on Wednesday that Badie, along with 36 others, who served as ministers in the government led by the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, who was supported by the Brotherhood between 2011 and 2013, deserved life behind bars for inciting violence and murder. 
Badie has been viewed as a key element in the Muslim Brotherhood, a party which operated under numerous restrictions during the era of the country's former dictator, Hosni Mubarak. The senior Brotherhood figure played a major role in the popular uprising that led to the ouster of Mubarak in January 2011. 
During the Wednesday session, the court also upheld the death sentences for 10 other individuals, who had been tried in absentia. 
A criminal court in 2014 tried 47 defendants, who include former youth and supplies ministers, for charges of murder, attempted murder, resisting authorities, assaulting policemen, sabotage, and blocking a main road in the Nile Delta city of Qalyubia. 
The general legal procedure against the Muslim Brotherhood began in July 2013, when Morsi was ousted in a military coup. The head of the Egyptian armed forces, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, came to power afterward. Sisi is believed to have orchestrated the coup as well as the ensuing crackdown on the Brotherhood. 
Estimates provided by human rights campaigners show that 1,400 people have been killed and 22,000 have been arrested in relation to the crackdown on the members and supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
Morsi himself has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for escaping prison in 2011. The Appeals Court endorsed the sentence last week, rejecting his appeal.

Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei says Saudi Arabia’s killing of Yemenis is ""the worst type of terrorism."" 
“Terrorism is not limited to terror acts committed by some unofficial groups, and mass killings of people by certain governments, such as the Saudi attack on people in a mourning procession in Yemen, which left hundreds killed and injured, are the worst type of terrorism,” the Leader said in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö in Tehran on Wednesday. 
Ayatollah Khamenei also described terrorism as one of the “painful” sufferings gripping the human society, and called for a sincere fight against the scourge. 
“Countering terrorism needs the serious resolve of all those who have an influence within global powers,” the Leader said, calling on world pundits and governments to take measures to deal with the phenomenon.

Ayatollah Khamenei also said the US and certain Western countries are not sincere in the fight against terrorism. 
“These governments calculate all issues based on their own interests, and they do not think about eradicating the malady of terrorism in Iraq or Syria,” the Leader added. 
Ayatollah Khamenei further criticized UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon’s failure to condemn the Saudi war on Yemen. 
“The UN secretary general said explicitly that it is not possible for the body to condemn the killing of Yemeni children as the UN depends on the Saudi government’s money,” the Leader said, stressing that this approach is indicative of the “deplorable moral state” of politicians at the helm of international organizations.

(Photo by AFP) 
The US military forces have secretly been using an airbase in Tunisia for drone operations to gather intelligence from inside oil-rich Libya, officials say. 
The announcement was made by unnamed sources cited in a Washington Post report on Wednesday. 
Libya has been struggling to contain the Daesh Takfiri terrorists, who started expanding their presence in the country following the overthrow and death of longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011. 
The base has apparently been in use since late June in an alleged effort to support the Libyan government’s fight against the terrorists currently in control of the northern city of Sirte. 
The US has also been using bases in Niger and Djibouti but those ones are farther away. 
Efforts by the administration of President Barack Obama to Access the airbase were meant to keep drones and small Special Operations teams within striking distance of the militants and close a “blind spot” for US and Western spy agencies. 
The officials also asserted that the drones were unarmed and tasked with gathering intelligences, adding, they could be armed in the future if Tunis agrees. 
The Tunisian government is yet to issue a possible response to the report. 
Drones tasked with assassination in the North African country usually fly out of Naval Air Station Sigonella on the Italian island of Sicily. 
The reason for keeping use of the airbase secret has been mentioned as part of the Obama administration efforts not to harm Tunisia’s “young democracy,” as put by the Washington Post . 
Washington conducts targeted killings through remotely-controlled armed drones in several African and Middle Eastern countries. 
The United States claims the airstrikes target members of al-Qaeda and other militants, but according to local officials and witnesses, civilians have been the victims of the attacks. 
The airstrikes, initiated by former US President George W. Bush, have been escalated since Barack Obama took office in 2009. 
International organizations and human rights groups say the airstrikes flout international law.

(Photo by Reuters) 
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is pushing for its biggest military buildup near Russian borders, as the Western military alliance continues to harbor perceptions of a Russian “threat” since the days of the Cold War. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will discuss the plan for military deployments to the Baltic states and eastern Poland at a two-day meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. 
The military alliance aims to send “battle groups” to the Baltic states and Poland early next year. The groups will consist of 40,000 forces. It will be the biggest military buildup near Russia since the Second World War. More forces would also be deployed if necessary. 
“This is credible deterrence. Not to provoke a conflict, but to prevent conflict,” Stoltenberg claimed contradictorily on Tuesday, referring to the planned deployments near Russia. “Concrete proof that NATO can and will deploy thousands of forces to support our allies. And a clear demonstration of our transatlantic bond.” 
The United States, Germany, Britain, and Canada have already agreed to contribute forces to the “battle groups,” which are to be deployed to Poland, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.

France, Denmark, Italy and other NATO members are expected to contribute forces of their own but have been reluctant so far. 
Anti-Russia by default 
Russia had previously warned that it would take unspecified measures to respond to the increased activities by the Western military bloc. 
It also moved nuclear-capable missiles to its westernmost region of Kaliningrad, near its border with the Baltic countries and NATO member states earlier this month. The Iskander-M cruise missiles are capable of hitting targets across Poland and the Baltics. 
NATO was formed during the Cold War as a means of countering the former Soviet Union. 
The military alliance suspended all ties with Moscow in April 2014, after the then-Ukrainian Crimea Peninsula voted in a referendum to join Russian territory. 
Shortly afterwards, an armed conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine, areas inhabited by an ethnically-Russian population. The Ukrainian government, which militarized the originally peaceful unrest in the regions — known as the Donbass — has ever since been accusing Russia of having a hand in the conflict there. Moscow denies the claim. 
The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 9,200 people and left over 21,000 others injured.

(Via Reuters) 
Russia says it has cancelled plans for a fleet of its warships to refuel at a Spanish port on their way to Syria. 
Vasily Nioradze, a spokesman at the Russian embassy in Madrid, said on Wednesday that the request was canceled, without giving further details, the Associated Press reported. 
The Spanish Foreign Ministry also confirmed that Russia had withdrawn its request for the warships to refuel in the Spanish port of Ceuta. 
""The Russian embassy in Madrid has just told us that it is withdrawing its demand for permission to stop over for the boats, which means that the stopovers have been cancelled,"" the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. 
The development came after Spain, a NATO member state, said it was reviewing Russia's request to refuel its naval fleet at Ceuta after passing through the Straits of Gibraltar en route to Syria, where Russian forces are engaged in an anti-terror campaign in support of the Syrian government. 
In a statement released on Wednesday, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said that Spain had been allowing Russian navy ships to dock in Spanish ports for years, but that it treated such requests on a case by case basis. 
The naval group, which passed through the English Channel on Friday, is made up of Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as a nuclear-powered battle cruiser, two anti-submarine warships and four support vessels, escorted by submarines. 
The fleet will join around 10 other Russian vessels already off the Syrian coast. 
Ceuta sits on the tip of Africa’s north coast, across the Straits of Gibraltar from mainland Spain, and bordering Morocco. The port is part of the EU, but its NATO status is unclear. Since 2011, at least 60 Russian warships have docked in Ceuta. 
NATO irked by Spain’s announcement 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg claimed that the Western military alliance was ""concerned"" by the deployment of the Russian warships. 
""It is each up to each nation to decide, as has been NATO policy for many years, but we are concerned about the potential use of this carrier group to increase attacks… in Aleppo,"" Stoltenberg said, adding, ""All allies are aware of our concerns."" 
Britain echoes NATO’s stance 
British Defense Secretary Michael Fallon also said on Wednesday that London would be ""extremely concerned"" if Spain refueled the Russian carrier group heading through the Mediterranean towards Syria. 
""NATO should be standing together,” he added. 
Since March 2011, Syria has been hit by militancy it blames on some Western states and their regional allies. Russia has been conducting air raids against Daesh and other terrorist groups in the Middle Eastern country at the Damascus government’s request for more than a year now. 
Russia boosts Baltic Fleet 
In another development on Wednesday, a report said that Russia was reinforcing its Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad with two small warships armed with long-range cruise missiles to counter a worrying NATO build-up in the region. 
The report by Russia's daily Izvestia quoted an unidentified military source as saying that the vessels, the Serpukhov and the Zeleny Dol, had already entered the Baltic Sea and would soon become part of a newly formed division. 
Kaliningrad shares land borders with Poland and Lithuania. 
The deployment comes at a time when NATO is planning its biggest military buildup on Russia's borders since the Cold War.

The Assassination of Russia - FSB false flag bombings of 1999 https://youtu.be/y9cRoXgawVA In the fall of 1999, a wave of bloody apartment bombings swept through Russian cities, killing 293 people and causing widespread panic. Although blamed on the Chechen terrorists that the Russians were fighting in the Second Chechen War, FSB agents were caught planting the exact same type of bombs as in the other blasts later that month. The government claimed that the bomb was part of a security exercise and Vladimir Putin came to power as the next Russian President on the back of the terror wave later that year. http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a092299ryazanbomb#a092299ryazanbomb On the evening of September 22, 1999, several residents of an apartment block in Ryazan, a city about a hundred miles south of Moscow, observe three strangers at the entrance of their building. The two young men and a woman are carrying large sacks into the basement. The residents notice that the cars plate has been partially covered with paper, although they can still see a Moscow license plate number underneath. They decide to call the local police. After several bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow earlier in the month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999), their vigilance is understandable. When the police arrive, around 9:00 p.m., they uncover what appears to be huge bomb: three sacks of sugar filled with a granular powder, connected to a detonator and a timing device set for 5:30 a.m. The bomb squad uses a gas testing device to confirm that it is explosive material: it appears to be hexagen, the military explosive that is believed to have been used to blow up two Moscow blocks. The residents are evacuated. Then the bomb carted away and turned over to the FSB. (In an apparent oversight, the FSB fails to collect the detonator, which is photographed by the local police.) The following morning, September 23, the government announces that a terrorist attack has been averted. They praise the vigilance of the local people and the Ryazan police. Police comb the city and find the suspects car. A telephone operator for long-distance calls reports that she overheard a suspicious conversation: the caller said there were too many police to leave town undetected and was told, Split up and each of you make your own way out. To the polices astonishment, the number called belongs to the FSB. Later this day, the massive manhunt succeeds: the suspects are arrested. But the police are again stunned when the suspects present FSB credentials. On Moscows orders, they are quietly released. On September 24, the government reverses itself and now says the bomb was a dummy and the whole operation an exercise to test local vigilance. The official announcement is met with disbelief and anger. Ryazan residents, thousands of whom have had to spend the previous night outdoors, are outraged; local authorities protest that they were not informed. However, the suspicion of a government provocation is not widely expressed and press coverage fades after a few days. It is only several months later that an investigation by the independent weekly Novaya Gazeta re-ignites the controversy (see February 20, 2000 and Fall 1999). The governments explanations will fail to convince skeptics (see March 23, 2000). The Ryazan incident later becomes the main reason for suspecting the government of having orchestrated previous bombings. The controversy is then widely reported in the international press.

But the bomb-squad officer, Yuri Tkachenko, is adamant that it was a professionally-prepared, military-style bomb. He defends the accuracy of his sophisticated gas-testing device which identified the explosives as hexogen. The article provokes much comment in Russia but is ignored by the government.

[Source: Terror99.ru]A team of FSB officials, led by Alexander Zdanovich, agrees to a televised meeting with angry and suspicious residents of Ryazan, hoping to put down rumors of a government provocation and shore up the credibility of the official account. In September 1999 a bomb was found in the basement of a building in Ryazan and the people arrested for planting the bomb were discovered to be FSB agents. The government then claimed the incident was merely a training exercise, but residents suspect the FSB wanted to bomb the building to create a fake terrorist incident (see September 22-24, 1999). Zdavonich apologizes for the inconvenience suffered by Ryazan inhabitants but then suggests the renewed interest in the event is a campaign ploy: For months, there was no interest and there were no publications. The theme was activated on the eve of the presidential election with the most fantastic details in order to accuse the FSB of planning a real explosion with the death of people. This is actively used in the political struggle. (The presidential election is only one week away.) A soldier named Alexei Pinyaev has claimed that he worked at a nearby base where hexogen was reportedly kept in sacks marked sugar (see Fall 1999). The commander of the base denies that there was any soldier named Pinyaev, but the Novaya Gazeta reporter who had found Pinyaev then shows pictures of him and plays a recording of his interview. The FSB will not let its three agents appear in public or allow journalists to interview them. The broadcast does not allow any discussion of a possible connection between the Ryazan incident and the apartment bombings in Moscow earlier that month (see September 9, 1999 and September 13, 1999). The FSB officials did not have good explanations for the fact that local authorities, including its own FSB office in Ryazan, were not informed of the supposed exercise, or for the lack of medical resources for the thousands of people forced to spend the night outdoors. According to David Satter, a long-time correspondent in Moscow for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times who believes the Ryazan incident was a failed provocation, the broadcast only serves to increase the publics misgivings.

In the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillary’s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. 
Peter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podesta’s home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadzik’s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
As the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement “is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of state’s email practices.” As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaign’s “cozy relationship” with the Obama Justice Department. 
The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podesta’s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzik’s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
“The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I don’t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,” says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
“ It’s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton ,” he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. 
Kadzik’s role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
A Long, Friendly History 
Podesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a “fantastic lawyer” who “ kept me out of jail.” 
As the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. “He did lie to me,” Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clinton’s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that “Kadzik was recruited into Marc Rich’s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.” 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Rich’s pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Rich’s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clinton’s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
Kadzik’s current role 
In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . 
In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained “that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.” 
DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynch’s appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obama’s political appointees — a list which includes Kadzik — “are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. ” 
It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantis’ questions. 
Kadzik’s first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. 
Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBI’s files of the Clinton email investigation.

Senior White House officials blocked the Navy from conducting needed freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea amid growing concerns that China is militarizing newly reclaimed islands, according to the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board. 
A working paper produced in September 2015 by John Hamre, the policy board chairman, called for an immediate resumption of Navy warship passages to prevent China from taking over the strategic Southeast Asian waterway.

Top NATO & EU officials expressed anger at Spain’s permit reportedly issued to a Russian aircraft carrier group to take on fuel and supplies at Ceuta, a city with unclear political status. Spain says Russia’s warships have been mooring there “for years.” 
A barrage of harsh statements followed when Spanish media reported that Russia’s naval battle group led by aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov would make a stopover at the autonomous port of Ceuta after passing the Straits of Gibraltar on Wednesday. 
Battle Stations! Putin’s fearsome fleet locked, loaded & ready for war with Britain… or not 
Russian ships would moor in Ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by Spain’s Foreign Ministry, Spanish newspaper ABC reported on Tuesday, also citing Defense Minister Pedro Morenes, who said that “there was a prior authorization for this particular case.” 
Guy Verhofstadt, former Belgian prime minister and currently EU envoy for Brexit talks with the UK, expressed his outrage, calling Spain’s decision “the harassment of EU and NATO forces.” 
In a Facebook post, he said that NATO member Spain “provides assistance to a fleet which has one purpose,” adding that “only last week this Spanish Government signed up to a statement from the European Council accusing Russia of war crimes against civilians in Aleppo.” 
Later in the day, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg made it clear that the bloc wants Madrid to rethink the stopover permit. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
“We are concerned and I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russia’s ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria,” he said. 
“This is something I have conveyed very clearly before and I repeat those concerns today and I believe that all NATO allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against Aleppo and Syria.” 
He then downplayed the rhetoric, noting that “it’s for each nation to decide whether these ships can get supplies and be fuelled in different harbors along the route towards the eastern Mediterranean.” 
Late Tuesday night, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said it was “reviewing” the decision. “The latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from Russian authorities,” the ministry said in a statement, quoted by Reuters. 
Earlier in the day, however, the ministry told RIA Novosti that Madrid allows Russian ships to dock in Spanish ports as “routine navigation” which effectively lies outside EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. 
In the meantime, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry told the Telegraph the requests from the Russian Navy “are considered on case-by-case basis,” stressing that “Russian navy vessels have been making calls in Spanish ports for years.” 
Ceuta, an autonomous Spanish enclave on the tip of Africa’s northern coast, lies along the Straits of Gibraltar and borders Morocco, which also claims the territory as its own. 
Although Ceuta is part of the EU, its status within NATO is still unresolved. Since 2011, Spain has rankled the bloc by allowing 57 Russian warships to refuel at the enclave. 
The mission of the Admiral Kuznetsov carrier group has already triggered a media frenzy across Europe, with British, Norwegian, and Dutch navies sending frigates and surveillance vessels to shadow the Russian warships as they round European shores through international waters. 
Once they reach Syrian shores, the ships will provide backup for Russia’s naval standing group already deployed to the area, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.

Around 300 civilians were killed in eleven airstrikes conducted by the US-led coalition in Syria, which Amnesty International investigated for its latest report. Amnesty says the US must come clean about the civilian toll of its fight against Islamic State. 
Amnesty suspects that US Central Command (CENTCOM), which directs coalition airstrikes in Syria, “may have… carried out unlawful attacks” in Syria, failing to take necessary measures to prevent civilian killings. 
“We fear the US-led coalition is significantly underestimating the harm caused to civilians in its operations in Syria,” said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for Research at Amnesty International’s Beirut regional office. 
“It’s high time the US authorities came clean about the full extent of the civilian damage caused by coalition attacks in Syria. Independent and impartial investigations must be carried out into any potential violations of international humanitarian law and the findings should be made public.” 
Amnesty investigated evidence, including eyewitness accounts, reports by human rights organizations and the media, photographs and video footage as well as satellite imagery, related to 11 suspected coalition attacks in Syria. The group estimates that the attacks have claimed as many as 300 civilian lives. So far none of these deaths has been acknowledged by CENTCOM. 
The report published on Wednesday added that the total civilian death toll from coalition action “could be as high as 600 or more than 1,000” since the operation against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) started in Syria in 2014. 
One of the strikes investigated by Amnesty took place in the early hours of December 7, 2015. The attacks hit two houses in the village of Ayn al-Khan, near al-Hawl in al-Hasakah governorate in northern Syria, killing 40 civilians, including 19 children, and injuring at least 30 others, the report said. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
According to an eyewitness account, an initial night strike was followed by a second attack from a helicopter gunship, which hit first responders trying to dig out survivors. 
“At this point I had a two-month-old baby boy in my arms whom I had rescued. The hit caused me to fall and drop him… I fell into the hole made by the air strike. That was what saved me… My mother, aunt, wife and children – a daughter who was four years old and a son who was two and a half were all killed. The woman and her son who I’d rescued were killed. Everyone but me was killed,” the survivor said. 
The strike is believed to have targeted IS fighters. But local Kurdish militia reportedly warned the coalition that there were civilians in the area. 
Amnesty said CENTCOM’s failure to acknowledge civilian deaths in Syria, as well as the poor record of investigating such incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq, poses grave concerns over the toll which the civilian population of Mosul, Iraq is likely to face from the ongoing operation to take the city from IS. The US-led coalition is providing air support for the offensive. 
“Given the likely increase in air strikes by the US-led Coalition as part of the Iraqi offensive to recapture Mosul, it is even more pressing that CENTCOM be fully transparent about the impact of their military actions on civilians. And it is crucial that they adhere scrupulously to international humanitarian law, including by taking all feasible precautions to spare civilians and to minimize harm to civilian homes and infrastructure,” said Maalouf. 
A similar operation to capture Manbij, Syria, which is far smaller than Mosul, killed more than 200 civilians, Amnesty estimated. 
Last week, Amnesty International blasted Russia for civilian deaths in Aleppo. The Syrian city is divided between government forces and various armed groups, including the Al-Qaeda offshoot Al-Nusra Front. Russia says that the militants use civilians as human shields and would not allow them to leave the city, derailing several attempts by Russia to open humanitarian corridors out of the city.

He blamed US President Barack Obama for creating ISIS saying: “I don’t know what would have happened if we had carried out strikes. What I can say is that we did not carry out strikes, and there’s Daesh.” 
Now party members are giving up on the leader following the hapless blunder. 
The party are scrambling to pick up the pieces, looking to Prime Minister Manuel Valls – who is disliked in the party – and Segolene Royal – the environment minister and an ex partner of Mr Hollande who is equally unsuccessful in electoral races.

An editor of Austria’s largest paper, Kronen Zeitung, is to be tried for hate speech over a commentary he wrote about the migrant crisis last year. 
On 25 October 2015, Christoph Biro wrote of the masses of migrants who were travelling through the Styrian countryside and remarked on the assaults and property damage committed by migrants, reports Kurier . 
Calling the majority of the migrants “testosterone-driven Syrians”, Mr. Biro recounted the multiple reports of migrants carrying out, in his words, “extremely aggressive sexual assaults”. 
He also detailed Afghan men had slashed the seats of the trains that were transporting them to Germany because they refused to sit where Christians had previously sat.

Samantha Bee is proof positive that being funny, clever, or photogenic are no longer requirements in leftist media. I guess we can call that progress. Problem is, whatever the size of Bee’s audience, there is still an audience. Which she lied to. Par for the course in leftist circles, but this one needs a rebuttal. Samantha Bee said “Partial birth abortion” is not a thing, while she ranted and raved at Donald Trump for his comments in the final debate . Sorry, Sammy. Partial birth abortion is sadly a thing… 
Here’s what I find interesting: Bee’s need to explain away partial birth abortion shows just how unpopular the procedure is. She’s trying to get rid of it. Not unlike a woman hoping to chop shop her unborn baby . Of course she stops short of saying “it’s a heinous, evil thing for people to do to their own children,” by excusing the sick, evil, twisted women (and the “doctors” who perform the butchery) who make it happen. Sorry, there is no reason to suck the brains out of a partially born baby for the “health of the mother,” or “if the baby has a terminal disease.” 
Abortion is always wrong. Like, always. 
Because chopping up a baby while it’s partially hanging out of the mother, its head still in the birth canal, because it’s “going to die anyway” makes sense. If you agree with killing a baby like this, for any reason, you’re sick. Probably a little bit evil. Read Dear Evil Women Who Abort their Babies… Yep, that was written for you abortion supporters. Not sorry.

Wikileaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behind-the-scenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in American history. 
Remember the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the conspiracy surrounding “podiumgate” ? 
Hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didn’t want to appear shorter than Trump. 
After the debate was over, however, a sneaky “cleaner man” was caught on tape approaching Hillary’s podium multiple times, removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it. What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump’s just after the debate officially ended. 
This led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. 
Well, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it’s very possible. Why? A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
Because apparently Hillary can’t give long speeches without a podium. 
In fact, these emails (and this isn’t even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept “short and sweet” unless Hillary has a podium. 
So how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? 
Especially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

One of Norway’s nuclear reactors was discovered to be leaking radioactive iodine Monday morning, according to the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). [1] 
In a statement released today, the NRPA said: 
“The radioactive leak was due to a technical failure during treatment of the fuel in the reactor hall. Emissions are low.” 
Experts say contamination levels around the Institute for Energy Technology, in the southern town of Halden, were well within legal limits and posed no risk to the public. 
Said Per Strand, deputy director-general at the NRPA, a government regulator: 
“Of course it’s an unfortunate situation but there is a low environmental risk. This is not the sort of leak we want.” [2] 
The radioactive iodine was a byproduct of the uranium which powers the facility. 
Staff were evacuated from the institute, but later returned, donning protective gear, to assess the cause and extent of the leak, and halt it. 
A senior NRPA official said the incident would “maybe” be rated a 1 on the International Nuclear Event Scale, which rates nuclear incidents from 1 to 7. By comparison, the incidents at Fukishima and Chernobyl were ranked 7. [3] Source: The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
Regulatory officials were frustrated that they were not notified about the leak until today . Atle Valseth, a research director at the Institute for Energy Technology, agreed. He said: 
“I don’t sit so close to those decisions but I think we should have informed the authority yesterday. We will have to go through why it wasn’t reported — it wasn’t good enough that we didn’t report it yesterday.” [2] 
Strand, the head of safety, preparedness and environment at the NRPA, expressed the regulator’s frustration. 
“We need to gather more information … But we are not happy with the situation, that we were not warned immediately. We will investigate further.” [3] 
The Swiss Radiation Safety Authority (SRSA) said i t has not detected any radiation emanating from the facility, which sits close to the Swiss border. 
Mark Foreman, a nuclear expert at the Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden, stressed that the vast majority of the radioactive iodine is trapped inside the fuel, which is contained within a ceramic material. The ceramic-wrapped material is stored inside a metal tube that is welded shut. The tube is inside the reactor. 
The iodine would have to leak out of the reactor to enter the reactor hall.

A lot of people want to see the BRICS fail. Western nations, in particular the United States and Britain, are prime suspects. However, there are plenty of unwitting commentators in the emerging world who are playing into the West’s hands. Each year, as the BRICS summit draws near, the cacophony from these haters grows louder. Questions about the viability and relevance of the BRICS are raised in the media. 
During the build-up to the Goa summit this year, the refrain was similar but with the background buzz that the India-China rift over Pakistan-backed terrorism would derail the summit. However, the predicted outcome of an implosion didn’t materialise and, on the contrary, with India and Russia inking the S-400 missile deal , Goa 2016 turned out to be a memorable event. 
Since many innocent readers may have been misinformed by the compromised commentators – who will certainly be back like a bounced cheque next year – here’s a ready reckoner on the BRICS group. So the next time you hear remarks that the BRICS are collapsing, don’t lose sleep over the issue. World needs BRICS 
Most of the global multilateral institutions that exist today are no longer relevant. The IMF and the World Bank, for instance, were founded during the closing years of World War II. In geopolitical time, that’s ancient history. Similarly, the G-7 appears to be on life support and the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) is no longer a leading organisation. 
Russia, China and India must play a leading role in greater Eurasia 
With the western economies perched on monetary and budgetary cliffs, the five BRICS members provide a stable alternate force that offsets the West’s decline. Both China and India continue to experience high economic growth and are on course to become mega economies that will completely dwarf the West in the coming decades. Beijing’s growth may have fallen under 7 per cent but that’s enough to add the equivalent of Holland’s national income to the Chinese GDP. 
Bottom line: without the BRICS, the world economy will experience 1929 all over again. BRICS slowdown, not a meltdown 
Uday Kotak, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank, feels India should quit the BRICS coalition because of the slowdown in four of the five economies. His view has been echoed by several so-called experts. But curiously, have you ever heard any economist or banker say the OECD must disband because it has basket cases such as Greece or terror exporters such as Turkey? 
According to the US-based Centre on Global Interests , “You can look at the BRICS from the financial market's point of view, or from a geopolitical point of view. But whichever lens you view it through, what you see is the same: despite economic slowdowns and even economic hardship in some nations, these are far and away the most powerful countries outside of the developed core. Their economies have scale. Their decisions can move financial markets. They have intellectual capital and clout within their regions. And in terms of foreign policy, they are the counterweight to a unipolar world run largely by Washington and its friends in London and Brussels.” 
It adds: “In both of these regards – economics and foreign policy – the BRICS are alive and kicking. In fact, they are more relevant today than they were in November 2001, when Jim O'Neill grouped them into the strange bedfellows that they have become.” Bilaterals can’t bring down the BRICS 
If the UN fails to discuss relevant political issues, the international body is considered a failure. But BRICS is not a platform that was created for discussing politics. The primary role of the five-member group is to remove the West’s grip from the levers that control the world economy. By establishing their own New Development Bank, the BRICS have ensured that the IMF is no longer the world’s lender-of-last-resort. 
In this backdrop, fears that bilateral issues involving India and China will wreck summits have consistently proved to be baseless. 
It’s time for BRICS to go on political overdrive 
Take Goa 2016. While the Goa Declaration mentions terror, the focus of the summit was not terrorism at all. Sure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a shot at Pakistan, describing it as the “mothership of terrorism”, and China defended its ally by saying it had made “great sacrifices”. But both New Delhi and Beijing were merely playing to their respective galleries even as the real summitry was happening behind closed doors. 
To be sure, politics can be tabled if it’s a side dish – like Syria was a couple of years ago – but issues with the potential to derail the summit simply have no place in BRICS. 
Critics of the BRICS often point to the India-China border issue as evidence of serious problems. But this misses the point. There always will be different opinions and views among the BRICS countries – just like there are differences among NATO or European Union members. BRICS are not united but it doesn’t matter 
Unlike NATO or the European Union, where the member countries have more or less the same goals and are also of the same racial stock, each of the BRICS countries is different. However, their membership of BRICS gives them a common goal – development. As emerging countries, they are focussed on raising their standards of living. 
The fact that they are united as a group, despite such stark differences in national goals, opinions and geopolitical rivalries and even outright hostilities, points to the viability of the BRICS.

Facebook russia , china , migration 
Experts predict a possible growth in the migration flow from China into Russia, by 2050 the Chinese may become the second largest population group in Russia, Scientific Director of the Center for Migration Research of the Institute of National Economic Prediction of Russia’s Academy of Science Zhanna Zayonchkovskaya said. 
""The number of unemployed people in China is more than the entire Russian population,"" she noted at an international conference at the North Caucasus Federal University in the Russian city of Stavropol, dubbed as ""Migration processes.""""If we maintain solid relations with China then I think by 2050 the Chinese may become the second largest population group in Russia and surpass the Central Asian populace as far as migration goes,"" the expert said. 
Zayonchkovskaya said the reason for this process was that after 2030 the migrant inflow from Central Asian countries would decline as a large part of young people had already left these countries to work or study in the neighboring states. 
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are the main countries whose citizens come to Russia, Ukrainians migrate in large numbers, too. ""If we think of other countries from where migrant labor can be obtained, I can think of none other than China,"" Zayonchkovskaya noted, emphasizing that ""Russia will need foreign workers to ensure its economic development."" 
According to the expert, the changes in the pension legislation would not balance the situation given the decrease in the working-age population. ""Raising the retirement age will neither level out the demographic waves, nor will it solve the labor shortage problem, as it only solves the problem of the Pension Fund, though the demographic situation still remains problematic,"" Zayonchkovskaya added noting that according to the Federal Migration Service, the international migration flow into Russia in 2015 had amounted in 9.8 mln people.

Mais les temps changent, et cette région russe montagneuse est aujourd'hui plus célèbre pour ses projets artistiques. Nouvelles galeries, street art, Biennale d'Art de la Jeunesse… Les artistes émergents fourmillent, sans oublier les racines industrielles de la région. Faites défiler vers le bas pour voir plus Denis Tarasov Guennadi Vlassov est né en 1943 à Sverdlovsk (aujourd'hui Ekaterinebourg). Il est diplômé de l'école de commerce Ouralmach en 1961. OuralMach était un géant de la construction de machines, véritable étendard de l'industrie soviétique. Denis Tarasov Vlassov a travaillé comme artiste d'usine à partir de la fin des années 1960 jusqu'au début des années 1990. Il concevait des journaux muraux, écrivait des slogans et peignait des affiches satiriques. Denis Tarasov A la fin des années 1980, il aménage l'intérieur de la salle des outils de l'un des ateliers avec des répliques de célèbres paysages peints par des artistes russes et quelques unes de ses propres créations. Denis Tarasov Parmi les travaux connus, il a notamment copié la Fille à l'attelage en train de faucher par Arkadi Plastov, qui peignait des scènes de la vie quotidienne dans le style du réalisme socialiste. Denis Tarasov Dans les années 1980, les travailleurs eux-mêmes ont commencé à choisir des thèmes pour leurs armoires à outils – la plupart étaient des représentations de la nature. Au crépuscule de l'industrialisation, l'art était considéré comme un moyen de s'évader de la grisaille de l'usine. Denis Tarasov A l'heure de la modernisation, les peintures sont comme une bouffée d'air frais dans le royaume endormi des immenses machines condamnées au silence. Denis Tarasov Il y a quelques années, quelques uns de ces travaux ont fait leur apparition sur internet et ont retenu l'attention de plusieurs commissaires d'exposition d'Ekaterinebourg, qui ont présenté les conteneurs de Vlassov en tant que projet spécial lors de la Biennale d'art contemporain de la ville. Denis Tarasov Les conteneurs de Vlassov sont un exemple de la façon dont des objets de la vie de tous les jours se transforment en art contemporain une fois transposés dans une galerie.

Oktober 2016 Julia Shevelkina Russia Beyond The Headlines organisierte auf der Buchmesse eine Filmvorführung und eine Lesung zu den Solowezki-Inseln. Quelle:RBTH Hölle und Paradies liegen auf dem Solowki-Archipel nah beieinander, wie der russische Schriftsteller Ewgenij Wodolazkin auf der Frankfurter Buchmesse erklärte. Dort stellte er nicht nur sein neues Buch vor, sondern auch die RBTH-Kurzfilmdokumentation „Das Gedächtnis der Solowezki-Inseln“. 
„Viele leben gerne hier auf dem Solowki-Archipel. Der Sommer ist warm genug und der Winter ist kalt. Pilze und Beeren sprießen aus der Erde, Fische locken Angelfreunde und die Natur! Vor allem sie ist hier einfach atemberaubend.“ Ein schöner Ort eigentlich, wenn es nicht um die berühmt-berüchtigten Inseln im Weißen Meer ginge, wo sich zu Sowjetzeiten das erste große Häftlingslager befand, und nicht ein Mann spräche, der täglich Touristen hierhin bringt, um sie an die grausame Geschichte des Ortes zu erinnern. Der lange Weg auf die Solowezki-Inseln „Das Gedächtnis der Solowezki-Inseln“ heißt die Kurzfilmdokumentation , die das RBTH-Team vor einem Jahr drehte. Mit Foto- und Kameraequipment im Gepäck begaben sich junge Reporter damals auf eine lange Reise, sprachen mit Mönchen aus dem Solowezki-Kloster, fanden Gärtner, für die das Archipel ein gewöhnlicher Arbeitsort wie jeder andere ist, und besuchten das Fischerdorf Rebalda, wo seit Jahrzehnten Meerkohl gewonnen wird.
Der so entstandene Film wurde am vergangenen Samstag am russischen Stand der Frankfurter Buchmesse präsentiert. Die Einführung gab der russische Schriftsteller Evgenij Vodolazkin, der seinen neuen Roman „Aviator“ („Der Flieger“) vorstellte. In seinem Buch, das die vielschichtige Geschichte der Inseln thematisiert, lässt sich ein Häftling des Gulags 1932 im Rahmen eines Experiments einfrieren und überlebt so das Aufblühen und den Niedergang der Sowjetmacht. 1999 wird er entfrostet und fängt an, ein Tagebuch zu führen, in dem seine Erinnerungen an die Vergangenheit sich mit aktuellen Ereignissen verflechten.

„ Die Solowezki-Inseln spielen eine große Rolle in meinem Roman“, erzählte Vodolazkin dem anwesenden Publikum, „sie sind in gewisser Hinsicht stellvertretend für Russland zu betrachten.“ Einst habe es hier ein Klosterparadies gegeben, das später in die kommunistische Lagerhölle umgewandelt worden sei. „Zumindest dachte ich so, als ich vor fünf Jahren meine Arbeit an einem anderen Buch – den Erinnerungen der Menschen, die auf den Solowezki-Inseln einsaßen – begann. Aber dann stellte sich alles als wesentlich schwieriger heraus“, berichtete Vodolazkin. 
Denn das Paradies in Reinform habe es auf Solowki nie gegeben. Schon 1667 bis 1676 sei der Archipel Schauplatz einer schrecklichen Periode der russischen Geschichte gewesen, als die Inseln von zaristischen Truppen besetzt waren. Diese Zeit nennt Vodolazkin eine schlimme Form der Barbarei. 
„Und auch die Hölle war hier nie die Hölle in Reinform“, fügte der Autor hinzu. Sogar im Straflager habe es Beispiele für menschliche Größe gegeben. „Wenn Mönche, die dort lebten, Wärtern das Leben retteten, halfen sie damit eigentlich denjenigen, die ihnen Leid angetan haben“, erklärte Vodolazkin.

Mit diesem einfachen Beispiel zeigte Vodolazkin, wie widersprüchlich die Geschichte der Solowezki-Inseln doch war, und tauchte mit dem Publikum ein in die Welt des Dokumentarfilms. An das Heilige des Ortes erinnert der Film mit Aufnahmen der hölzernen Kreuze und Kapellen. Die kleinen eisernen Grabsteine mit der lakonischen Inschrift „Zwei Personen“ bringen den Zuschauer jedoch schnell in die Gegenwart der Solschenizyn-Bücher zurück. „Die Inseln erinnern sich an alles, was hier passiert ist.

Der irakische Ministerpräsident Haider al-Abadi hat am 17. Oktober den Beginn der Rückeroberung Mossuls verkündet. Die Großstadt im Norden des Irak ist seit Juni 2014 in den Händen des IS. Je nach Schätzung befinden sich derzeit bis zu 1,5 Millionen Zivilisten und 10 000 IS-Kämpfer in der Stadt. Bis zu 60 000 Mann zogen in den Kampf, um Mossul zu befreien: Kräfte der irakischen Armee, sunnitische und schiitische Einheiten und kurdische Peschmerga-Kämpfer. Die internationale Anti-Terror-Koalition unter US-Führung sorgt für Luftunterstützung. 
„Der Augenblick des großen Sieges ist nah“, erklärte al-Abadi zu Beginn der Offensive. Mehr als eine Woche nach der Verkündung wird jedoch deutlich, dass der Vormarsch der Anti-IS-Kräfte ins Stocken gerät. Gleich nach Beginn der Befreiungsoperation kam es zu Verwerfungen zwischen Bagdad und Ankara. Derweil geht der IS in bereits befreiten Siedlungen zu Gegenoffensiven über. Der republikanische Präsidentschaftskandidat Donald Trump wertete die Operation bereits als ein „totales Desaster“. Wer wird kämpfen? Kampf gegen IS: Russland liefert Waffen an irakische Kurden Der Militärexperte Wladimir Jewsejew, stellvertretender Direktor des Instituts der GUS-Länder, betont, dass die Zahl aufgestellter Truppen an sich nicht aussagekräftig sei: „Die Kurden haben gar nicht vor, Mossul zu befreien“, sagt er. „Sie haben kurdische Gebiete im Stadtumland eingenommen und gehen keinen Schritt weiter. Die Schiiten wird al-Abadi nicht nach Mossul lassen, um Massaker zu verhindern. Und die Türken – die schlagkräftigste Einheit von allen – werden die Stadt nicht stürmen, um eigene Opfer zu vermeiden“, erklärt der Experte. Es bleibe also nur die irakische Regierungsarmee. Dort blühe aber die Korruption und die Zahl der Deserteure sei hoch. „Von den angekündigten 60 000 Mann werden für die Eroberung Mossuls höchstens 30 000 bereitstehen“, sagt Jewsejew. „In einer vom IS stark befestigten urbanen Umgebung reichen diese Kräfte nicht aus.“ Zumal Mossul in westlicher Richtung offen sei, weswegen die IS-Kämpfer ständigen Nachschub bekommen könnten. „Bis zu den US-Präsidentschaftswahlen am 8. November ist die Stadt, anders als die USA es geplant haben, sicherlich nicht einzunehmen.“
Der Nahost-Experte und Politologe Leonid Issajew von der Higher School of Economics ist ebenfalls der Ansicht, dass ein langanhaltender Kampf bevorstehe. „Erst wird man um die Provinz, dann um die Stadt Mossul und dann um jeden einzelnen Stadtteil kämpfen müssen“, sagt er. Die Schlacht werde sich über Monate hinziehen und viele Opfer fordern. Sunniten gegen Schiiten Syrien-Frieden in der Krise: Wie geht es nun weiter? Doch auch wenn der IS in Mossul bezwungen werden sollte, werde das den Irak nicht befrieden, so die Experten. Mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit würde vor Ort ein neuer – konfessioneller oder ethnischer – Konflikt ausbrechen. Die schiitischen Einheiten hätten in den letzten zwei Jahren die sunnitische Bevölkerung nach der Befreiung vom IS massakriert – wegen der Kooperation mit dem Feind. Die Kurden verfolgten ihre eigenen Interessen: Sie expandierten territorial, wenn sie irakische Städte und Dörfer befreiten. Die arabische Bevölkerung werde verdrängt und kurdische Siedler nähmen ihren Platz ein.
Wie die Nachkriegsordnung in Mossul aussehen könnte, ohne dass es zu ethnischen und religiösen Säuberungen kommt, sei eine nicht weniger wichtige Frage als der Kampf gegen den IS. Wenn viele Religions- und Stammesgruppen nicht der Regierung in Bagdad unterstünden, sei eine solche Ordnung nicht ohne weiteres zu erreichen. Angst vor irakischem Aleppo Machtspielchen auf höchster Ebene: Der Syrien-Konflikt im UN-Sicherheitsrat Ein weiteres Problem: In Mossul verbleiben viele Zivilisten. Seit Beginn der Offensive wurden infolge von Luftschlägen der Koalition bereits Todesopfer unter der Zivilbevölkerung gemeldet.
Jewsejew betont, dass zivile Opfer beim Bombardement von Städten praktisch nicht zu vermeiden seien. Washington verstehe das und versuche eine ähnliche Situation wie in Aleppo zu vermeiden. Dort beschuldigt der Westen Russland und Syrien, Luftschläge gegen die Zivilbevölkerung zu fliegen. 
„Die Amerikaner erklären bereits, sie wollten nicht, dass sich Mossul in ein zweites Aleppo verwandele. Deshalb werden sie die Luftschläge auf ein Minimum zurückschrauben“, sagt Issajew. Zugleich stünden die Vereinigten Staaten vor einem Dilemma: „Das Bombardement führt zu mehr Toten unter den Zivilisten. Bleiben die Luftschläge aber aus, erleiden jene Kräfte Verluste, die die Stadt am Boden stürmen: Washingtons irakische Verbündete. Das erschwere die Einnahme Mossuls und die Koordination der Bodentruppen, so der Experte. RBTH-Check 37 bis 38 Millionen Menschen leben derzeit im Irak. Der Großteil – 75 bis 80 Prozent – sind Araber. Die Kurden sind mit 15 bis 20 Prozent die größte ethnische Minderheit. Sie leben in der Region Irakisches Kurdistan im Norden des Iraks, die seit Kriegsausbruch de facto von Bagdad unabhängig ist. Die Schiiten sind die größte Religionsgemeinschaft des Iraks – sie machen 60 bis 70 Prozent der Bevölkerung aus. Die Sunniten sind eine große Minderheit – 30 bis 40 Prozent. Der Islamische Staat bekennt sich zum sunnitischen Islam und betrachtet Schiiten als Häretiker. Der Norden des Iraks, insbesondere Mossul, wird überwiegend von Sunniten bewohnt.

Mit zwei Jahren konnte Bella kurze Sätze bilden und in drei Sprachen schnell lesen. Kurz vor ihrem dritten Geburtstag fügten ihre Eltern Chinesisch zum Ausbildungsprogramm hinzu. Laut Julia zeigte ihre Tochter ein großes Interesse an der neuen Sprache und wollte selbst Cartoons auf Chinesisch schauen. 
Mit drei Jahren und zwei Monaten lernte Bella mit Begeisterung Spanisch und Deutsch, aber nicht nur: Nebenbei tanzte sie, spielte Geige und sang. Später kam noch die arabische Sprache hinzu. Damals wie heute geht Bella spazieren, spielt Verstecken und liest normale Kinderbücher –in verschiedenen Sprachen. Grundsätzlich haben Spiele einen wichtigen Platz in ihrem Lernprozess. 
Die kleine Bella verbringt ihre Zeit mit Reisen mit Muttersprachlern, besucht eine englischsprachige Theatergruppe, hat Malunterricht auf Französisch, Tanzunterricht auf Spanisch und lernt Eiskunstlauf mit einem deutschen Muttersprachler. Außerdem organisieren ihre Eltern für sie Sprachunterricht mit ihren Freunden, die genauso mehrsprachig aufwachsen. Sprachen lernen ist gut für das Gehirn Авг 25 2016 в 10:32 PDT 

Wissenschaftler fanden heraus, dass die Fähigkeit, verschiedene Sprachen zu sprechen und zwischen ihnen zu wechseln, von unterschiedlichen Gehirnarealen abhängt. Sie werden je nach phonetischen Sprachmerkmalen, der Grammatik, Vorstellungen und sogar der Tonalität der Aussprache aktiv. 
„Jede neue Erfahrung führt dazu, dass unser Gehirn neue Nervenverbindungen herstellt”, erklärt Psychologin Tatjana Djatschenko. „Der für unser Gedächtnis zuständige Hippocampus stimuliert das Wachstum von neuen Neuronen. Dadurch wachsen wortwörtlich einige Gehirnareale.“ 
„Die Mehrsprachigkeit wirkt sich positiv auf die allgemeine Entwicklung des Kindes aus, obwohl es manchmal Sprachentwicklungsstörungen im frühen Alter verursachen kann. Dies tritt bei Kindern, die einsprachig aufwachsen, seltener auf”, sagt Kira Iwanowa, Mitarbeiterin des Instituts für linguistische Studien der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. 
Sprachunterricht im frühen Alter sei jedoch keine Garantie dafür, dass ein Kind diese Sprache später gut beherrschen werde, erklärt Maria Molina, wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin des Instituts für Sprachwissenschaften der Russischen Akademie der Wissenschaften. “Ich kenne ein Beispiel: Eine Mutter hat mit ihrem Sohn nur Englisch gesprochen, bis er drei Jahre alt wurde.

The system will provide self-protection to the helicopter against radar controlled weapons and IR seeking missiles by employing different counter measures such as chaffs, flares and directed infra-red. The Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) is intended to provide the capability of detecting, identifying warning and prioritizing air to air and ground to air threat missiles to the pilot. Fifteen Mi-17V5 helicopters would also be integrated with Laser Warning Receiver (LWR) and Directed Infrared Counter Measures.

I'm happy that now he will help Russian sport!"" Photo: The official mascot of the FIFA World Cup 2018 Wolf Zabivaka. Source: TASS 
Russians have voted for the mascot for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with the winner being declared 
a wolf called Zabivaka, who wears the national tricolor and goggles and swings his paw at the ball. He will soon appear on all soccer and soccer-related paraphernalia and merchandise for the upcoming tournament. 
The other finalists were a tiger and a cat, but popular opinion was not in their favor and the wolf ran off with 53 percent of the votes (the tiger cosmonaut received 27 percent and the cat 20 percent). 
A total of 50,000 participants and their mascots – from an Amur Tiger to an alien – battled for victory. However, in the end Russians decided that an animal that howls at the moon suits them best. For some the wolf is associated with speed and assertiveness, for others the chimerical chances of the national team winning the cup. 
However, the new mascot has opened something of a Pandora's box. Following the popular vote, the Russian internet has been inundated with quibbles and for several days Zabivaka was beset with unflattering comparisons from social network users who mocked the mascot's physical appearance and name. Goalscorer, hooligan or loafer? 
""Yesterday they decided to play a joke: They proposed to call the mascot Zabivaka. And the people? The people accepted it,"" joked a tweet on the official Kontinental Hockey League Twitter account . 
Many internet users noticed the ambiguity of the name – the verb zabivat in Russian can mean either to score (a goal) or to strike. This was ironic since former Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the name was just supposed to translate well and be original (for patenting purposes). Bear necessity: Designing a mascot for the 1980 Moscow Olympics 
""Something tells me that Zabivaka, written with Latin letters, does not make its etymology and meaning any easier for our English-language friends,"" wrote Twitter user @Bobchensk. 
However, social network users remembered that football inspires some to strike not only the ball: The photographs of aggressive football fans in Marseilles, France during the 2016 European Championship, when the Russian national team was almost expelled from the tournament, appeared all over the internet once again, while others showed Zabivaka among thugs attacking their victims. 
Another unfortunate association with the infinitive zabivat is the related construction zabit na , which means to be indifferent, or not to care. Social network users took advantage of this opportunity to make fun of the woeful results of the Russian national team in recent years. Here the poor wolf really took a beating. ""Football and the Russian lifestyle,"" wrote @ntnet, while @SashaBo4alova noted that the best Zabivaka in Russian football is not a wolf but “a loafer.” 
""I must say that Zabivaka the wolf has been my mascot at university and at work for the last 15 years. I'm happy that now he will help Russian sport!"" wrote Facebook user Sergei Fokin on his page. A cheap wolf 
The wolf's appearance also raised some issues. The main problem was addressed by @Maxi_Sar: ""Why the hell does the wolf need damned winter goggles if it’s a football world cup?!"" 
RBTH posed this question to the creator of the new World Cup mascot Yekaterina Bocharova, a 21-year-old graphic design student at Tomsk State University. 
""These are not winter goggles but just sports goggles, like the ones you use for cycling. It's just that Zabivaka is so fast on the field that he needs eye protection,"" she replied, adding that the goggles were also high-tech, for precise passes and strikes. Cheburashka: Fun facts about Russia's iconic furry character 
Bocharova said that she was always fascinated by Disney cartoons, that she dreams of working for this company and loves the animated film Ratatouille . Incredibly, FIFA paid her just $500 for the rights to the drawing. 
Journalists remarked (in Russian) that this was a tiny amount, noting that previous mascots cost much more. For example, the symbol of the Brazilian World Cup was Fuleko the armadillo and FIFA paid $100 million for his rights. The 1998 World Cup mascot Footix the rooster cost FIFA $30 million. 
FIFA then earns revenues from using the mascots on souvenir products. Footix brought the organization $27 million, while Zakumi the leopard, the mascot for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, earned FIFA $71 million. 
But Bocharova has no issues with her compensation. She says that FIFA gave her ""a lot more,"" and it has nothing to do with money. 
""All these positive feelings and meetings with amazing people. I think money can't buy all that,"" she said, implying her meetings with the Tomsk governor and the popular TV host Ivan Urgant, who invited Bocharova onto his talk show in Moscow. ""I would have not achieved all this without them. I am very happy and grateful for all this,"" she said.

There has been a dramatic increase in neurological diseases linked to aluminum toxicity . The blood brain barrier doesn’t stop aluminum’s intrusion into our gray matter. Aluminum accumulates and remains in tissue that doesn’t have a rapid cellular turnover. report this ad 
Apoptosis is the natural cell death and replacement process that occurs throughout the body, excluding cancer cells. Cancer cells keep reproducing and colonizing into tumors unless apoptosis is introduced or the cells are outright killed from chemical compounds, both natural and synthetic. 
Aluminum accrues to toxic levels over time in slow apoptotic cell turnover tissues, such as bone matter, the heart and the brain. The brain and its associated nervous system is where diseases such as Alzheimer’s , Parkinson’s, MS, chronic fatigue and other neurological or auto-immune diseases manifest, including the complete autistic spectrum, from learning disorders to full blown autism. 
There is no shortage of aluminum toxins in our environment. It’s in cookware, beverage containers, foil, cigarette smoke, cosmetics, antiperspirants, sunscreen, antacids, and those ubiquitous chemtrails that most ignore from which aluminum nanoparticles can be breathed into our lungs and routed directly into our blood or through the sinuses into our brains. 
Aluminum is in all vaccines. Injecting aluminum bypasses the possibility of eliminating it through normal channels. Straight into the blood it goes to be carried into the brain and heart, adding to their accumulated aluminum toxicity loads. report this ad 
According to Dr. Chris Exley, PhD, we have come into the aluminum age. Many trolling commentators love to explain how aluminum is the must common mineral on the planet and therefore it’s harmless. Dr. Exley has dedicated over two decades of his scientific life to researching aluminum toxicity. He calls the period of time from the early 20th Century to now the “Age of Aluminum.” 
Before then, aluminum remained in the ground as the most abundant mineral in earth that hadn’t yet been mined. Dr. Exley claims mining aluminum and using it in so many ways corresponds to the marked increase of neurological diseases. 

Dr. Chris Exley’s Message to the 2011 Vaccine Safety Conference 
A key aspect of his conference delivery concerned helping vaccinated kids improve their neurological damage. Ironically, it involves the second most abundant mineral in mother earth – silica. Exley has put kids who had autism spectrum disorders or other neurological damage from vaccinations on a form of silica known as silicic acid with excellent results. 
Silicic acid is basically oxygenated silica. Exley considers this the best and most bio-available way to get silica through the gut and into the blood, then into brain matter where it binds with the aluminum molecules and leads them out of brain cell tissue safely through the urine. 
He had used a Malasysian mineral water called Spritzer on aluminum toxic children suffering from autism spectrum disorders with significant success. Aluminum is in almost all vaccines. Later he and his team had 15 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients use that water at the same rate of one liter per day for 13 weeks. 
Aluminum levels were lower by anywhere from 50 to 70 percent in all the subjects involved, and of the 15 AD patients, eight no longer deteriorated and three actually showed substantial cognitive increase. Perhaps coconut oil is better for reversing AD, but mineral waters high in Orthosilicic or ionic silicic acid will reduce aluminum toxicity in the brain to help ward off AD. 
The more USA accessible mineral waters with similar levels of silicic acid to Spritzer, which can penetrate the blood-brain barrier, are Volvic and Fiji. My personal favorite is Fiji because it has the highest level of ionic suspended silica as silicic acid and is the least expensive. I’ve seen it in WalMart at $1.99 per liter. 
Also, People’s Chemist Shane Ellison analyzed various water bottles and said Fiji water bottles are free of BPA and “its chemical cousins”. Others he rates highly as BPA free are Voss, Evian, and Smart Water. 
The suggested protocol is at least five days consuming a 1.5 liter bottle of water daily. More is required for high levels of aluminum toxicity. Dr. Exley considers drinking the whole bottle within an hour as the most efficient method of detoxing aluminum from the brain. 
Dr. Exley explains that there are three commercial bottled waters listing silica amounts as milligrams (mg) per liter on the bottle. Fiji has the highest amount of the three. Neither of us is affiliated with Fiji. 
Silica mineral waters can be supplemented to help prevent dementia. Obviously it can also be used as an adjunct with pure cold pressed coconut oil to stop early onset Alzheimer’s or even reverse most of the symptoms after AD symptoms appear. More on coconut oil for Alzheimer’s can be found here . 
Aluminum (Al) is passed out through the urine when one supplements silica sufficiently. It seems there’s little danger of taking too much, as long as adequate water is consumed and vitamin B1 and potassium levels are maintained. 

More About Silica 
Silica helps ensure collagen elasticity of all connecting tissues in the body, including tendons and cartilage. This reduces aches and pains and maintains your body’s flexibility. It has also been determined that high levels of blood serum silica keep arterial plaque from building and clogging blood vessels. 
A major culprit for arterial plaque has recently shifted from cholesterol buildup to arterial calcification from serum calcium that is not absorbed as bone matter. It’s known that silica is an important part of building bone matter. 
Without sufficient silica, magnesium, and vitamin K2, calcium doesn’t become part of bone matter and remains in the blood to potentially calcify in the soft tissue of inner artery walls and the heart. 
Silica is vital for keeping strong bones and a healthy cardiovascular system. This qualifies silica as an essential anti-aging mineral that is much more than a skin deep beauty mineral. Other good sources of silica are the herb horsetail, cucumbers, and diatomaceous earth powder. 
Although these three other sources are helpful for the recent aforementioned reasons, they lack the ionic suspension of silicic acid found in the mineral waters to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. I just found these other sources for ionic silica or silicic acid as well, here and here .

Project Veritas has just released Part IV of it's multi-part series exposing numerous scandals surrounding the DNC and the Clinton campaign, including efforts to incite violence at Trump rallies and, at least what seems to be, illegal coordination between the DNC, Hillary For America and various Super PACs. 
Part IV focuses on a $20,000 foreign donation made by an undercover Project Veritas journalist to Americans United for Change (AUFC). Ironically, shortly after the $20k donation wire was released, the contributor's ""niece"" was offered an internship with Creamer's firm, Democracy Partners. 
In the new video, Creamer says: “Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters … I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising.” He also mentions a conference call discussing a woman potentially coming forward to accuse Trump of inappropriate behavior. 
Creamer, a seasoned Chicago activist who is married to Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), whose Republican opponent, Joan McCarthy Lasonde has called for her to resign over her husband’s activities, also talks about his work with Barack Obama, whom he says he has known since the 1980s, when Obama was a community organizer in Chicago: “He’s a pro, I’ve known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago.” 
Elsewhere, Creamer adds: “I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the… the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.”",english,2016-10-27T21:04:39.455+03:00,redflagnews.com,US,44451,"Project Veritas 4: Robert Creamer's Illegal $20,000 Foreign Wire Transfer Caught On Tape | RedFlag News",0.215,http://static1.squarespace.com/static/4f34530ecb12e336a9dfe29c/5686c7ba0e4c11c93490eaf4/581171a4d482e93fc65add15/1477538649485/Robert-Creamer-jpg.jpg?format=1000w,0,0,0,0,0,bs

As it happens, the Communists already had a leg up on them. We’ll explore how this was done, along with some new twists.
The criticism and self-criticism technique in history This is what happens to people who joke about Chairman Mao ripping off Hillary’s wardrobe.
The technique of “ criticism and self-criticism ” (kritika i samokritika) was developed during the early days of the Soviet Union . This got results. When the early Soviet show trials and purges took place, the targets would confess to committing treason—the details stretching credulity—and beg for execution. The Maoists (Chinese Communists) used it too, typically during “ struggle sessions .” Also, forced confessions were required in Vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps .
What happened wasn’t much different from a medieval inquisition. Those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did. Of course, physical forms of coercion were also an option. These weren’t actual trials; their fates were already decided.
The lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before, after their memorable reminder to toe the Party line. Others faced stiffer penalties than that: from loss of Party membership (and accompanying status) all the way up to execution. No amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed.
After the ordeal, survivors were surely scared witless. With their egos beaten down, they were ready to do as they were told without question. It’s basically a form of brainwashing. As for those who were executed after that, the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience. It was political theater, convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers, and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line.
Other than that, the “criticism and self-criticism” technique—badgering and forcing a confession—also was picked up in the USA during the 1960s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups. Today, we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past, but the truth is that they’ve merely changed form . As I’ve noted previously , cultural Marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive “for-export” variety of Communism, so it’s no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes.
Modern witch hunts This is what happens to people who say that Bruce Jenner is actually a dude.
When people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things , this causes a “walking on eggshells” atmosphere. In today’s politically correct climate, it’s easy to run afoul of the Thought Police. This might result in a visit to the HR Department, or a campus “speech code” investigation. However, if the thoughtcrime is serious enough—or the target is prominent enough—then this can ignite a media circus . Also, someone could end up featured on a mailing list for Social Justice Warriors . Besides just trolling and harassment, this can result in doxxing (release of your personal information) or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal.
We in the Western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech. That was one of the main goals of liberalism, back in the 18th Century when liberalism was still a good thing. Actually, many “free” countries criminalize politically incorrect speech. Even in places that don’t have legal penalties for speaking your mind, it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood . This effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate, which naturally is the whole point. Other goals, of course, are information control and thus thought control. So much for freedom of speech! It took a few centuries, but liberals now oppose what they once stood for.
The following scenario has happened time and again. Someone points out an inconvenient truth , writes something that offends someone, donates to the “wrong” cause, mocks a feminist’s First World problems , tells an off-color joke , or even wears the wrong T-shirt . Then the feeding frenzy begins, resulting in torrents of criticism. Usually the target apologizes profusely, but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are.
It’s possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that you’re not guilty of something, but good luck getting the media or an online SJW mob to calm down and leave you alone! The traditional Communist session was better in one way. That is, they quit after breaking the target’s will. A modern feeding frenzy, though, can drag on for months, even after the target has been begging for forgiveness. What goes on the Internet can stay there forever, including lies about you.
If you get caught in a Social Justice Weenie witch hunt , never apologize. Explain and clarify if you absolutely must. This is for the benefit of the uncommitted; the SJWs will already have made up their small minds about you and won’t stop no matter what you do. Never let them break your frame! Instead, go on the attack. You have a right to your own opinion and to express it.
If you beg for their forgiveness, then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your self-criticism. Remember that groveling is unlikely to save you! Apologies are for people who actually did something wrong. Having a difference of opinion isn’t wrong, despite some people’s curious notions about freedom of speech.
Here are some other particulars to remember:
You can’t reason with them ; online mobs don’t know you and have been told that you’re an evildoer. You’ll probably never know exactly what was said about you, who said it, and what email list all that was on. (If you do find out, sue for defamation of character.) However, you can be sure that you’ve already been deemed guilty. They’re not interested in the truth. SJWs have great difficulty comprehending basic logic. Many of them don’t even believe in objective reality ; only their feelings are real to them. Why would the truth matter to these idiots? Finally, Social Justice Weenies are a bunch of losers . Their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out. Therefore, don’t let these oxygen-wasters mess with your self-esteem. Societal criticism and self-criticism Wallowing in guilt at its finest
The Frankfurt School , a Communist think tank that moved to the USA and began subverting the educational system, developed critical theory . One of their top classics was Eros and Civilization by Herbert Marcuse. It contained lots of Freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals. Another was The Authoritarian Personality by Theodor Adorno. That too contained Freudian mumbo-jumbo, smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo Daddy issues. All told, they wrote dozens of books along those lines, some attacking Western civilization directly. These vaporings wouldn’t have amounted to much, if they hadn’t become trendy in academia and influenced the 1960s zeitgeist.
Meanwhile, radical feminism—the Second Wave—was starting up. This too had lots of Communist influence , another front of cultural Marxism. This also was all about criticism of our culture. This caused friction between the sexes, driving a wedge deep into the heart of society. The results included the snarky, snotty, and spoiled attitudes you’ve surely encountered. Worse, this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes .
This was one of several movements that became prominent during the 1960s and are still with us today. (Surely you can think of many others.) The methodology was the same—all angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them. The way they tell it, they’re out fighting for their rights. The goal of cultural Marxism, though, was all about attacking our morale and softening us up. The people involved in those movements were merely tools, being used by leaders who were in it for power, money, and status.
The educational system has been dumbed down . History has been rewritten too. Figures like Christopher Columbus and the US Founding Fathers are bad guys now. Even as early as the 1980s, campuses were hell-bent in purging “DWEMs” (their charming term for “dead White European males”) from the literary canon. None of this was really about inclusiveness; it’s all about robbing our people of our heritage, making us ashamed of our accomplishments, and destroying our resolve.
The propaganda is everywhere. Television is full of social and political messages, even in shows for children , and piggybacked onto advertisements too. “Sensitivity training” courses deliver politically correct indoctrination. College campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda. This even happens to elementary school kids. (My first exposure was in second grade.) Some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation, such as forcing them to fill out “privilege” checklists (with the facts cherry-picked ) to instill a sense of “collective guilt.”
All this has worked according to plan. Many are out of touch with their roots, and don’t understand that they have a heritage worth preserving. Worse, others have been infected by guilt trips. Sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt; again, there’s the self-criticism part.
The antidote to this is the truth. The fact is, every civilization has its good points and its bad points, and ours is no exception. It’s rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world, while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others . The truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in Western civilization, but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique.
You can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they won’t be indoctrinated. You can always get rid of your TV too. Meanwhile, though, millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers, and of course the lying media. Those pushing this from the top down must be called out, exposed, and removed from power.

En nuestro siglo la inapetencia sexual puede tener causas serias que la convierten en una grave enfermedad. Imagen Ilustrativa Pixabay / Takmeomeo Síguenos en Facebook 
La llamada 'anorexia sexual' es un trastorno todavía poco conocido que puede convertirse en la ' plaga del siglo XXI '. Según la definición que el doctor Patrick Carnes propuso en su libro 'Anorexia sexual', publicado en 1997, es ""un estado obsesivo en el cual la tarea física, emocional y mental de evitar el sexo domina la vida de alguien"". 
""Los anoréxicos sexuales son aquellas personas que para evitar la intimidad rehúyen cualquier tipo de vínculo más profundo; de la misma manera que un anoréxico evita comer porque cree que está más gordo de lo que es en realidad, un anoréxico sexual es alguien que evita el contacto sexual porque tiene aprensiones de carácter psicológico"", explica la psicoterapeuta sexual Natalia Guerrero. El origen del trastorno 
El extraño trastorno afecta tanto a hombres como a mujeres. Son personas que, a pesar de sentir deseo, se prohíben disfrutar de cualquier placer sexual porque lo perciben como una amenaza. Los psicólogos apuntan que las causas del fenómeno tienen un origen muy profundo que podría encontrarse en la sociedad contemporánea. Las personas simplemente no saben construir relaciones y recurren a la producción erótica en forma de revistas, películas e Internet, de manera que proyectan sus deseos sexuales hacia imágenes y videos y no hacia personas. 
En algunas ocasiones, la anorexia sexual tiene su origen en la niñez, ya que las personas que durante la infancia fueron víctimas de acosos sexuales en el futuro pueden sufrir el trastorno. Las mujeres violadas también evitan las relaciones íntimas durante mucho tiempo, mientras que algunas personas renuncian al sexo tras haber sido rechazadas por los objetos de sus deseos sexuales. ¿Hay solución? 
El problema es cada vez más frecuente, pero tiene solución. ""Los problemas que tienen que ver con esta esfera se pueden trabajar con una terapia sexológica , pero cuando los casos son muy graves, se requiere de trabajar en una interconsulta con un psiquiatra, porque a veces el problema forma parte de un cuadro de fobias más generales"", afirma Guerrero.",spanish,2016-10-26T21:33:22.318+03:00,rt.com,US,538,"Anorexia sexual, la plaga del siglo XXI: ¿por qué no quieres tener sexo? - RT",0.264,https://esp.rt.com/actualidad/public_images/2016.10/article/58109ae9c36188291f8b469a.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

The company is currently seeking a $85 billion acquisition deal for Time Warner. 
Documents show the telecommunications giant was not only working with US Drug Enforcement Agency but routinely sold customer data to local police departments who were investigating a range of crimes from murder to Medicaid fraud. The documents were first reported by The Daily Beast. AT&T provides the leads, then investigators just happen to find the exact same evidence through police work: https://t.co/d01Uc4iWYm — The Daily Beast (@thedailybeast) October 25, 2016 
Under its secretive program called Hemisphere, AT&T could search trillions of call records and analyze cellular data to determine where a target is located, with whom they speak and potentially why. 
The documents also show the company only required an administrative subpoena, a lower-level legal document which – unlike a search warrant – does not require authorization from a judge. Police departments paid anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million a year for access to the Hemisphere program. Under the agreement, police were prohibited from disclosing use of the program to the public or even in court. 
“Like other communications companies, if a government agency seeks customer call records through a subpoena, court order or other mandatory legal process, we are required by law to provide this non-content information, such as the phone numbers and the date and time of call,” AT&T told the Beast in a statement.

Because of the ban on disclosing the existence of the Hemisphere program, law enforcement agencies were covering their bases by later seeking a court order for a wiretap, or trailing a suspect to gather evidence equivalent to what they had acquired through Hemisphere. 
Unlike other telecommunications providers, AT&T stores metadata – call time, duration, location data – of its customers going back to 2008. AT&T was one of the first companies to be exposed for its role in government surveillance when it shared its customer’s metadata with the NSA. 
Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician and whistleblower, revealed details about the NSA installing network hardware at a San Francisco, California site known at Room 641A to monitor, capture and process American telecommunications, beginning in 2002. 
“I knew this wasn’t legal because the NSA is not supposed to do domestic spying,” Klein told RT in an interview in 2015. He said the engineering documents showed “they were tapping into the main data flow on the internet and sending that data down to the secret room.” 
“I knew that was totally illegal. The apparatus itself did not provide for any kind of selection it was just a vacuum cleaner sweep of everything. That violates the Fourth Amendment right there which requires warrants for specific information,” Klein said. 
AT&T was also known to have a “partnership” – through its Hemisphere program – with the DEA for the purpose of counter-narcotics operations. 
The revelations come as AT&T’s proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner has surveillance critics and privacy advocates alarmed. 
Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, told the Daily Beast he opposed the merger because it would allow AT&T ""to use Time Warner’s content as bait to invade every aspect of the lives and habits of its nearly 30 million wired customers of its broadband and television services – many through its DirecTV subsidiary – and its more than 100 million wireless subscribers."" 
“It’s commercial surveillance,” Chester told the Beast, noting that through mobile devices, AT&T can even pinpoint the geographical locations of users.",english,2016-10-26T21:36:37.322+03:00,rt.com,US,538,AT&T sold access to customer data to law enforcement – report,0,https://img.rt.com/files/2016.10/article/5810de25c46188b83c8b4625.jpg,0,1,974,0,974,bs

More than half of the population of Bavaria demonstrated either “moderate” or “strong” antipathy towards Muslims living in Germany, a study conducted by the Social Studies Institute of the Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich said . It also reported that another 34 percent of Bavarians said they had “slight” dislike for followers of Islam. Read more Merkel suggests Christmas carols, flute-playing in face of ‘Islam concerns’ 
Only 11 percent of respondents said they had no bad feelings about Muslims living in Germany, the research published on Monday added. 
The study was based on a comprehensive survey that examined people’s attitudes towards eight different “distinct” groups of society – Muslims, refugees, Jews, Roma, foreigners in general, as well as people of a different race, homosexuals and the long-term unemployed. 
It featured from three to 10 questions that varied depending on each group in focus and that were presented in the form of statements that the respondents had to agree or disagree with. 
The study particularly featured such statements as: “There are too many Muslims in Germany,”“Foreigners/refugees endanger my financial situation/personal way of living,” and “Many long-time unemployed people systematically shy away from work.” 
The research was conducted between April and June 2016 and relied on surveying people from more than 1,700 households across Bavaria. 
Of all the groups in question, Muslims were the only one that stirred up “strong” negative feelings among more than 20 percent of the Bavarian population, while in all other cases it never exceeded 10 percent, and was between 3 and 6 percent on average. 
However, Muslims were not the only group that was perceived mostly negatively by Bavarians. The second most negatively perceived group was actually the long-time unemployed, as more than 80 percent of Bavarians had at least “slightly” negative attitude towards them, although only 4 percent had a “strong” animosity towards this section of society.

Refugees and the Roma (gypsy) community were also among the groups that were viewed least favourably, as only 27 percent of Bavarians had no negative feelings towards each of these groups. Ten percent of Bavarians said they had a “strong” negative attitude towards Roma – the second highest figure among all the groups in focus. 
In the case of refugees, about a third of Bavarians held either “moderate” or “strong” antipathy towards them. 
At the same time, the study showed that people of Bavaria have no negative attitude towards foreigners living in Germany in general as 56 percent of respondents said they had no bad feelings towards foreigners and only 10 percent of those questioned demonstrated “moderate” or “high” level of animosity towards them. 
Bavarians were also almost equally tolerant towards gay people as 54 percent of respondents showed no antipathy towards them. They were also even less prone to what the study called “classic racism” that consists in viewing white people more positively than the people of other races. About three quarters of respondents showed no signs of racism at all, while only about 10 percent of them had “moderate” or “strong” racist views. 
The study also showed that men are more prone to various forms of negative attitude towards the distinct groups in focus than women as well as that people having higher level of education tend to be more tolerant and less prejudged towards all these groups.

The research also stressed people that have a strong national identity or have low level of trust to the political institutions are also inclined to have a negative attitude towards the distinct groups mentioned in the study. 
However, the results of the study provoked significant concerns among social scientists, activists and even some churchmen. “In general, there is already a clear negative attitude [towards various distinct groups],” Christian Ganser, a social scientist from the LMU, told German media, adding that “group-focused hostility is a widespread phenomenon in Bavaria.” 
The present social developments that concern negative attitudes towards various groups of society do not fit into the classic conception of right wing extremism, Miriam Heigl, an expert from the Center for Democracy of Munich, told dpa news agency. 
Animosity towards distinct groups is no more a phenomenon linked only to some fringe extremist groups, Ganser, who is a co-author of the study, stressed, adding that it is now “a phenomenon [related to] the average people.” 
“To harbor a pejorative attitude towards others out of fear to lose own identity is no Christian way,” Martin Schneider, a member of the Catholic township council of Munich, told German KNA news agency, commenting on the results of the study. He added that “those, who ostracize outsiders, go against Jesus” Christ. 
At the same time, the issue is not limited to Bavaria, as sentiments similar to those presented in the study are common across the whole of Germany, Ralf Melzer, who works for the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, told dpa.

On October 22, two days before the study was published, German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested that any Germans concerned about Islam should combat the perceived Islamization of Germany with flute-playing and Christmas carols. 
“I know there are concerns about Islam,” she said at a congress of her party, the Christian Democratic Union, in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, while calling on people to rely on their Christian values and traditions to tackle this challenge. 
On October 3, the German finance minister and close Merkel ally, Wolfgang Schaeuble, called for the creation of “German Islam” that would combine traditional Islamic norms with the principles of tolerance and European liberalism to help integrate millions of refugees from the Middle East into European and particularly German society. 
Meanwhile, the anti-Muslim and anti-migrant sentiments in Germany are on the rise as the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party gains strong support at the expense of Merkel’s Christian Democrats. 
German ‘anti-Islamization’ movement Pegida (which stands for ‘Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West’) staged a massive rally in Dresden on October 16 to mark the group’s second anniversary.

Several complaints were lodged about the ad which producers say attempts to be all-inclusive with the people it features.

A man dressed as a construction worker arrived at the site early Wednesday morning to inflict some serious damage on the Hollywood Boulevard star. Using a sledgehammer, the man later identified as Jamie Otis attacked the star, literally pounding it to dust as onlookers watched. 
Trump’s star has seen a lot of abuse during his presidential run. From being spray-painted with a Swastika to being covered in dog feces and having its own wall built around it, the star has been a target for disgruntled Americans angered by the Republican candidate’s controversial statements.

Otis originally planned to remove the star and then auction it off, with the money going towards victims of Trump’s alleged sexual harassment and assault. Speaking to reporters at the scene, Otis explained “four or five” of his family members had been victims of sexual assault, and he wa s “terribly upset that we have a presidential nominee who is the poster child for sexual violence.” 
Over the past month, nearly a dozen women have come forth to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them in the past. Most are represented by Gloria Allred, a California lawyer and outspoken Democrat. 
The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which is in charge of the Walk of Fame, condemned the star’s destruction. 
“The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,” Chamber of Commerce’s Leon Gubler said. “When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark. Our democracy is based on respect for the law. People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property.” 
The Chamber of Commerce is working to prosecute those involved, Gubler said, adding that the star will be repaired immediately.

Gula’s identity was a mystery for 18 years, until McCurry finally tracked her down in 2002, after returning to the region more than 10 times hoping to find her. 
Gula’s parents were killed in Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan war. 
In 1992, Gula left Pakistan and returned to Afghanistan where she married a baker and had three children in a village in Eastern Afghanistan. National Geographic was able to verify Gula was the famous girl by comparing her moles and scar, as well as using iris scanning technology. 
""Her eyes are as haunting now as they were then,"" McCurry said at the time. ""She remembered me, primarily because she had never been photographed before I made the image of her in 1984, or since then.""

“The story of… Gorino is a difficult matter to judge. On the one hand, a part of the population is very tired and concerned by reports of new [asylum seeker] arrivals. On the other hand, we are talking about 11 women and eight children [later it was reported that there were 12 women],” he said. 
The incident in Gorino on Monday night saw protesters use planks of wood and iron bins to create road blocks at three entrances to the commune, while shouting anti-migrant slogans. The women were then relocated to neighboring towns and communes. 
Earlier on Tuesday, the Italian Interior Ministry said that more than 153,000 asylum seekers had arrived in Italy since the start of 2016. 
Over a million people, fleeing from wars in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere, flooded Europe in 2015, causing the largest migrant crisis faced by the continent in decades. 
Thousands of refugees arrive in Italy every month as they brave the dangerous boat trip across the Mediterranean from Libya, which has already led to hundreds drowning. 
In September, Hungary sealed off its southern border with a wire fence to stop the flow of refugees.

وذكرت صحيفة ""الغارديان"" البريطانية أن 3 رجال اتهموا سعيد طوسي، الحاصل على جائزتين عالميتين في تلاوة القرآن، بالتحرش الجنسي والاغتصاب عندما كانوا في الـ12 من أعمارهم، لكن السلطات القضائية تجاهلت الدعاوى المقدمة ضده، الأمر الذي وضعها في موقف حرج جدا. 
وذكر بعض الضحايا، لشبكة التلفزيون الفارسي التابعة لإذاعة ""صوت أمريكا""، أن دعاواهم قوبلت بالرفض من قبل النظام القضائي، فيما تناولت صحيفتا ""شرق"" و""اعتماد"" تقارير تؤكد أن طوسي، الذي يبلغ من العمر 46 عاما، قد قام باعتداءات جنسية. 
ووصف سعيد طوسي تلك الدعاوى بأنها كاذبة، قائلا إنها تهدف إلى تشويه صورته وصورة المرشد الأعلى الإيراني، علي خامنئي. 
وبلغ عدد الأشخاص الذين تحدثوا عن اعتداءات جنسية تعرضوا لها من قبل الطوسي 10 أشخاص، وقال أحدهم إن القارئ المشهور للقرآن اعتدى عليه عندما كان على متن طائرة في طريقه إلى مسابقة قرآنية، موضحا: ""لقد تلمس جسدي في الطائرة، وتحرش بي، وعندما كنا في الفندق كان من المقرر حجز غرفتين، بينما قام بحجز غرفة واحدة، متعمدا ذلك"". 
وقال شخص آخر: ""لقد أخذني إلى الحمام بحجة أنه يقوم بتدليكي وهنا فعل فعلته، وكان عمري حينها 12 عاما"". 
وأضاف أن طوسي كان مرعوبا بعدها وأخذ يتوسل إليه بألا يخبر أحدا.

وقال دميتري بيسكوف، الناطق الصحفي باسم الرئيس الروسي، الأربعاء 26 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول: ""الأهم بالنسبة للرئيس الروسي ليس ترامب وليست كلينتون، إنما الشيء الأهم بالنسبة له هو مصالح روسيا. ومن أجل مصالح روسيا، كما قال الرئيس مرارا، فهو مستعد لإجراء مفاوضات مع أي زعيم دولة أجنبية، ولا سيما مع رئيس الولايات المتحدة، من أجل تطوير علاقات ثنائية متبادلة المنفعة تساهم في ازدهار الدولتين"". 
وجاء تصريح بيسكوف، في معرض تعليقه على ما قاله المرشح الجمهوري في الانتخابات الأمريكية، دونالد ترامب، حين رجح أن بوتين لن يريد التعامل مع الديمقراطية هيلاري كلينتون في حال فوزها بالانتخابات. 
وشدد بيسكوف، قائلا: ""سؤال من سيترأس الولايات المتحدة، ليس مسألة تخص بوتين أو روسيا، إنما هي مسألة تخص الناخب الأمريكي"". 
الخارجية الروسية: ننتظر أن تتهمنا واشنطن بتدبير ""ثورة ملونة"" 
بدوره، أعرب سيرغي ريباكوف، نائب وزير الخارجية الروسي، عن دهشته مما وصلت إليه واشنطن في اتهاماتها السخيفة الموجهة إلى روسيا بالتدخل في العمليات الانتخابية بالولايات المتحدة. 
وتابع، في معرض تعليقه على الاتهامات الموجهة إلى روسيا بمهاجمة الشبكات الإلكترونية للحزب الديمقراطي في الولايات المتحدة: ""فيما يخص الاتهامات بشن هجمات إلكترونية، فهي أمر مثير للأسف أن نرى انحدار السياسيين الامريكيين إلى مثل هذا المستوى من كره روسيا"". 
وتابع بسخرية، أنه ينتظر أن يصل الأمريكيون لحد اتهام روسيا بتدبير ""ثورة ملونة"" في الولايات المتحدة، على غرار ""الثورات"" التي دعمتها واشنطن في عدد من دول الاتحاد السوفيتي السابق. 
وسبق لـ كلينتون أن اتهمت روسيا بالتدخل في الحملة الانتخابية بالولايات المتحدة، من أجل دعم خصمها دونالد ترمب، في الوقت الذي يعتبر فيه المرشح الجمهوري هذه المزاعم مثيرة للسخرية. 
وتعود هذه القضية إلى اختراق البريد الإلكتروني التابع للجنة الوطنية للحزب الديمقراطي الأمريكي، إذ بدأ موقع ""ويكيليكس"" بنشر رسائل مسربة لموظفي الحزب تتعلق بملابسات الحملة الانتخابية الأخيرة، وتثير شكوكا حول انحياز قيادة الحزب في سياق الانتخابات التمهيدية داخله، والتي فازت فيها كلينتون. 
وفي الخريف الحالي، بدأ الموقع بنشر رسائل لرئيس حملة كلينتون الانتخابية، جون بوديستا، تتضمن العديد من المعلومات والتصريحات الحساسة لوزيرة الخارجية السابقة، بما في ذلك تصريحاتها في مناسبات خاصة. 
وبغض النظر عن الاتهامات بشن الهجمات الإلكترونية، يبقى موضوع روسيا ورئيسها حاضرا بقوة خلال المراحل النهائية للسباق بين ترامب وكلينتون، قبيل الانتخابات التي ستجري في 8 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني. وفي الوقت الذي لا تضيع فيه كلينتون أي فرصة لمهاجمة بوتين وسياسته حول سوريا، يؤكد ترامب استعداده لبناء علاقات جيدة مع روسيا. والبحث عن حل وسط حول سوريا. 
وفي آخر تصريح له، اعتبر ترامب أن خطة منافسته الديمقراطية حول سوريا ""ستؤدي إلى حرب عالمية ثالثة"" بسبب احتمال نشوب صراع عسكري مع روسيا. 
وقال ترامب، في مقابلة مع وكالة ""رويترز""، إن هزيمة تنظيم ""داعش"" تحظى بالأولوية على إقناع الرئيس السوري بشار الأسد بالتنحي.

From the Army’s Future Combat Systems (FCS) that focused on fighting the last war to its RAH-66 Comanche stealth helicopters that never quite got off the ground, between 1997 and October 2016, the Pentagon invested $58 billion on weapons technology it never received. That doesn’t include the boondoggle that is the F-35 jet , which was finally declared “ready for combat” at the beginning of August. 
The FCS ($20 billion) and the Comanche ($9.8 billion) are just two of 23 major weapons programs that were canceled before they were finished, and together the two Army projects made up more than 50 percent of the “sunk costs” outlined in the Pentagon’s annual internal acquisitions performance review. The 224-page report by Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall was published earlier this week. Read more 5 costly Pentagon projects of dubious merit 
The report noted how much money was spent on each canceled program, how far along in the process they were before they were killed, and if any of the technology was rolled up into new programs. For example, although the FCS was canceled, parts of it ‒ including many of the manned ground vehicles and the Intelligent Munitions System ‒ were swept up into a current program called the Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization Program. 
Most of the programs were killed before they blew through their budgets, but eight of them spent all the money allotted to them before the Pentagon canceled them, the report found. 
The Government Accountability Office, a Congressional watchdog, conducted an audit of Pentagon spending in 2011 and found $70 billion in waste, the New York Times reported at the time . Much of the overspending happened because the DOD started building weapons systems before the designs were fully tested, the auditors said. 
With acquisitions overruns long being a thorn in the side of the Pentagon’s budget, in March the Air Force enlisted IBM’s Jeopardy! -winning cognitive computer , Watson. Two contractors are currently working to create programs that would enable Watson to navigate the 1,897-page Federal Acquisition Regulation, helping potential government vendors actually bid for military contracts. The project is expected to become operational by 2018. 
Another way the Pentagon has sought to cut down wasted spending is through the latest update to its acquisitions program, called ‘Better Buying Power 3.0’, which was announced in April 2015 . The program was designed to have “a stronger emphasis on innovation, technical excellence, and the quality of our products,” Kendall wrote in a memo ordering the program's implementation. It calls on the military-industrial complex to make projects more affordable in terms of funding, schedule and manpower throughout the entire lifespan of their products. It will also reward contractors for successful expense management, and ask them to eliminate unproductive processes and unnecessary bureaucracy. 
Of course, holding contractors accountable for their failures when it comes to major cost overruns or weapons systems that don’t work is easier said than done. And it doesn’t help when someone at the Pentagon thinks it’s a good idea to spend money on bomb-sniffing elephants .",english,2016-10-26T23:00:09.403+03:00,rt.com,US,538,Failed weapons systems cost Pentagon $58 billion over two decades,0,https://img.rt.com/files/2016.10/article/5811008fc36188251b8b4618.jpg,0,1,873,0,873,bs

Un artista mexicano crea criaturas robóticas que roban energía eléctrica para hacer música y se alimentan de bacterias de ríos contaminados. El proyecto 'Plantas Nómadas' evidencia el modo en el que nos relacionamos con el medio ambiente Proyecto Plantas Nómadas Síguenos en Facebook 
Una oruga creada con tubos aparece colgada en cables de luz, hace ruido, convive con otras orugas como ella y sus cantos ""forman parte del paisaje urbano"". Una mosca vuela con vibradores de celulares y una araña de alambres y juguetes viejos toma desechos de la basura para construir nuevos seres como ella. 
Estos 'Parásitos Urbanos' creados con desechos tecnológicos pretenden hacernos reflexionar sobre las consecuencias de cómo usamos y gestionamos nuestros residuos. 
De alguna manera, explica su creador a RT , son ""organismos de vida artificial"" que surgen de la basura y vienen a la ciudad para ""parasitarla"". 
""Las preguntas que me hago tienen que ver con el impacto de la tecnología en la vida cotidiana en nuestro entorno"", dice Gilberto Esparza, artista mexicano formado en la Universidad de Guanajuato, en la región del Bajío, cruzada por el contaminado río Lerma. Plantas nómadas 
Después de los parásitos urbanos, Esparza creó otro ser, simbionte entre plantas, bacterias y una máquina, que camina solitario y lento al lado de ríos contaminados para alimentarse de ellos y limpiar el agua. 
""Utilizamos el agua como vehículo de deshechos"", afirma Esparza. 
La intervención tenía que ver con el tema del agua, y su intención era realizar una reflexión acerca de cómo convivir con el agua para revertir la contaminación. 
""Cómo hace la planta nómada para sobrevivir, entender, reconocer cuál es el entorno y aprovecharlo"", se pregunta. 
El artista explica que la planta nómada se integra al ecosistema y tiene la posibilidad de sobrevivir. Eso hace una simbiosis con su entorno. En el agua hay bacterias, las recoge y las lleva a pilas biológicas, contenedores internos, donde se desarrollan y empiezan a alimentarse. Luego invita a las bacterias que están en el agua. Las bacterias, en sus procesos metabólicos, generan electricidad. 
El agua limpia es llevada a otro contenedor dentro del robot y de ahí es tomada para hacer crecer plantas extintas en lugares contaminados. Finalmente, las plantas aportan energía al robot; esa es su estrategia para sobrevivir. Una planta nómada explora en un río contaminado. Proyecto Plantas Nómadas 
""Si lo proyectas a una ciudad, si comenzamos a cambiar nuestras estrategias, manera de relacionarnos, obviamente eso va a impactar de manera positiva en el entorno"", opina. 
""No es que su pretensión sea limpiar el río, sino que su actitud ante el río hace que el río se sane. Lo que busco con estos proyectos es reflexionar acerca de eso"", explica el artista. 
Esparza hizo un cómic en el que se ve esa etapa del robot, viviendo en el río. Al final, el agua se ve limpia y queda abierta la pregunta si fue porque los humanos lograron entender cómo relacionarse con el agua o porque se extinguió la especie de la planta nómada, que ya no tuvo de dónde alimentarse. Un parásito urbano ""interviene"" la ciudad Proyecto Parásitos Urbanos No son la solución, sino la reflexión 
La intención profunda de este trabajo con robots, explica Esparza, es entender a través de estos desarrollos que tenemos que cambiar nuestra relación con el medio ambiente en lugar de resolverlo desde la tecnología, de tal forma que los desperdicios ya no serían una basura, sino energía y materiales. 
El último proyecto de esparza se llama 'Plantas Autofotosintéticas', y pretende trasladar la idea de 'Plantas Nómadas' a una ciudad. 
La nueva planta funciona a modo de maqueta para explicar cómo podría ser a nivel sistémico el funcionamiento de una ciudad en el futuro y plantear el reciclaje de sus aguas para que tenga un consumo externo mínimo y para que se pueda autosustentar. Gilberto Esparza lleva diez años trabajando con robots para reflexionar sobre la problemática medioambiental. Plantas Nómadas 
""La verdadera forma de poder terminar con estos problemas de contaminación no es tanto generando nuevas tecnologías que hagan un parche que traten de estar limpiando lo que ensuciamos"" explica. 
Después trabajará con un instrumento sonoro con celdas microbianas con el que pretende traducir la actividad biológica electroquímica a sonidos. 
Su intención es hacer ""que suenen ríos contaminados""; después dará un disco con los resultados para que cada río se exprese. 
""El problema, y por eso no lo hemos logrado, es que nuestra lógica gira en torno a la economía y no a qué es lo que necesitamos"" opina el artista.

وصدرت على بديع عدة أحكام ابتدائية بالسجن وحكم ابتدائي بالإعدام في قضايا تتصل جميعها بالاحتجاجات العنيفة التي اندلعت عقب إعلان الجيش عزل الرئيس السابق محمد مرسي عام 2013 إثر احتجاجات حاشدة على حكمه. 
وقالت المصادر إن محكمة النقض، أعلى محكمة مدنية في البلاد، رفضت، الأربعاء 26 أكتوبر/تشرين الأول، طعنا تقدم به محامو بديع و36 شخصا آخرين بينهم عدد من قيادات الجماعة على حكم أصدرته محكمة للجنايات في يوليو/تموز 2014 بمعاقبتهم بالسجن المؤبد. 
وأفادت المصادر بأن محكمة النقض أيدت الحكم الصادر، ليصبح أول حكم بات ونهائي. 
ومن أبرز قيادات الإخوان التي شملها الحكم، الوزيران السابقان، أسامة ياسين وباسم عودة والبرلماني السابق محمد البلتاجي، بالإضافة إلى الداعية صفوت حجازي. 
وتتعلق القضية باحتجاج عنيف اندلع في محافظة القليوبية، شمال القاهرة، في 22 يوليو/تموز 2013، وأسفر عن مقتل شخصين وإصابة عدد آخر. 
وكانت النيابة قد وجهت اتهامات مختلفة للمتهمين من بينها القتل العمد والشروع في القتل والتجمهر والاعتداء على الأشخاص والممتلكات العامة والخاصة وقطع الطريق وحيازة أسلحة نارية وبيضاء والتحريض على التجمهر والاعتداء على المواطنين. 
كما شمل حكم الجنايات الذي صدر في 2014 معاقبة عشرة أشخاص بالإعدام غيابيا، لكن لم يشملهم الطعن الذي نظرته محكمة النقض، الأربعاء، لأن القانون ينص على وجوب إعادة محاكمة أي متهم يصدر بحقه حكم غيابي تلقائيا بمجرد تسليمه نفسه أو إلقاء القبض عليه. 
ويوم السبت، أيدت محكمة النقض حكما أصدرته محكمة للجنايات بسجن محمد مرسي 20 عاما في قضية تتصل بأحداث عنف اندلعت إبان فترة حكمه التي استمرت عاما واحد، وأصبح هذا أول حكم نهائي يصدر على الرئيس السابق الذي يحاكم في عدة قضايا.

Miriam Düsterhöft, 27, studies social science at university and believes that working at one of the refugee centers in Düsseldorf, Germany, will be a good experience. 
Düsterhöft told RT Russian that she wants to help refugees to integrate into Europe. Read more Christian refugees persecuted by Muslim asylum seekers in German shelters – survey 
“At first it was very difficult. There was a lack of essentials, it was hard to communicate with refugees. Many didn’t make any effort to learn German,” she said. 
One of the issues at the center was a lack of interpreters of Persian or Kurdish. There was a man who translated from Arabic for men, and a woman translating for female residents. 
“[Kurdish and Persian] women do not communicate with men, they are afraid to speak about certain things. Even we [volunteers] don’t know what they feel or need.” 
Asylum seekers have to spend at least six months at the center before authorities can grant them refugee status and provide them with accommodation. Sometimes they have to wait longer before receiving the status, or because the condition of the accommodation provided is much worse than that of the center, Düsterhöft said. 
Düsterhöft’s style of clothing at the center differs greatly from what she wears in her everyday life. Here at the migrant center she wears long skirts and trousers, and covers her hands with sleeves. 
“This is my decision – I have a lot of tattoos all over my body, and I don’t want to confuse people who aren’t accustoed to this. I don’t think that it infringes on my rights.” 
“No one has ever tried to rape me,” she added. This isn’t a random comment – asylum seekers have been accused of numerous sexual harassment incidents towards women and children in Europe since the start of 2016. 
Earlier in October, a female interpreter for a French journalist was raped near the notorious Calais ‘Jungle’ migrant camp. Reports also emerged that the woman’s attackers were three Pashto-speaking male asylum seekers. Read more 
Düsterhöft said she hasn’t had any major conflicts with refugees. The most serious incident was when the father of one child asked not to draw animals or humans during classes because Islam forbids the depiction of people. 
“We solved this issue and removed the controversial exercise,” she said. ‘There are bad people both among Europeans and migrants’ 
The mother of 18-year-old student Fiona Braun, who is giving German lessons to refugees, says that her life hasn’t changed with the arrival of asylum seekers. 
“My daughter works with refugee children from Syria and Afghanistan in camps in Vienna and in Bratislava,” Jana Olearnikova told RT Russian. 
“She [Fiona] now has a lot of female friends among migrants. Fiona comes home with new recipes that she learned from the Arab girls,” she said, adding that she welcomes “the opportunity to dive into Arab life” and likes “the diversity of cultures in Europe.” 
Olearnikova said she’s not afraid to walk alone in the evenings, despite the stories that have emerged since the refugee crisis started. 
“Of course, there may be criminals and bad people among migrants, but they may be among the Europeans, too,” she said. Syrian refugee: ‘ISIS killed my entire family, I have nowhere to go’ Read more More than 300,000 refugees in Germany work illegally, pay kickbacks to asylum center staff - reports 
Aid Abu Kasem was an architect back in Syria. He understands that when he receives refugee status, he won’t be able to find the same job in Germany. 
“But I don’t mind. The most important thing for me is to find myself in a new reality. I'm learning German, it’s very difficult, but I’m trying,” he told RT Russian.Kasem says it will be difficult for him to settle into his new home. 
“I know that in Germany there are common swimming pools and common saunas for men and women. They bathe together naked, although completely unfamiliar with each other. I can’t understand it. I guess I just won’t attend such places."" 
He said that the center in the town of Zirndorf, Bavaria, where he is currently living, was set on fire twice. 
“It’s unpleasant. I didn’t do evil to anyone and shouldn’t suffer for the fact that these people hate anyone who runs away from war."" 
“ISIS [Islamic State/IS] killed my entire family, I have nowhere to go, so I decided to start a new life,” he added.",english,2016-10-26T23:44:15.103+03:00,rt.com,US,538,"Life at migrant centers in Germany: RT talks to volunteers, refugees about their hopes & fears",0,https://img.rt.com/files/2016.10/article/5810b9b5c36188cf1c8b46fd.jpg,0,1,230,0,230,bs

تاريخ النشر: 26.10.2016 | 15:34 GMT | انسخ الرابط http://ar.rt.com/i5gn اكتشف فريق دولي من العلماء معلومات جديدة عن نظام المناعة الذاتية قد تحدث ثورة في عالم الطب وتؤدي إلى اتباع نهج مختلف في تطوير اللقاحات. 
من المعرف أن الوظيفة الرئيسية لجهاز المناعة لدى الإنسان هي التعرف على الأجسام الغريبة التي قد تدخل الجسم كالفيروسات والبكتيريا والقضاء عليها، وتسمى هذه الأجسام الغريبة والتي تثير الاستجابة المناعية في الجسم ""بالمستصدات"" أو ""مولدات الضد"" (antigen)، حيث تقوم باستثارة واستفزاز الخلايا المناعية التي تقوم بدورها بمهاجمة تلك المستصدات. 
حتى الآن جرى الاعتقاد بأن الغالبية العظمى من ""منارات الإشارة"" أو الأجسام التي تستثير إشارة الجهاز المناعي هي عبارة عن بنى بروتينية معينة في أجسام المستصدات. وفي نفس الوقت كان معروفا لدى العلماء أن خلايا المستصدات تنتج نوعين مختلفين من ""الحواتم"" (Epitopes) المختلف بعضها عن بعض من حيث التركيب . 
وفي هذه الحالة يزداد احتمال الخطأ من قبل خلايا الجهاز المناعي نظرا لمصادفة هذه الخلايا المناعية ومهاجمتها سلاسل من الأحماض الأمينية لخلايا سليمة في الجسم لكونها تظن أنها تابعة لأجسام غريبة مشابهة في تركيبها لتلك الأحماض الأمينية . 
وقد اعتقد في السابق أن احتمال وجود ""حواتم"" مشتركة أو متشابهة بتركيبها الجيني مع خلايا أخرى أمر نادر جدا. لكن بعد دراسات طويلة أجراها العلماء وبعد الاستعانة بطرق جديدة اتبعوها في دراساتهم، اكتشفوا عكس ذلك، واستطاعوا تحديد حوالي 25 % من الـ""حواتم"" التي تحتوي على أصناف من البروتينات التي ترسل إشارات للجهاز المناعي، واستطاعوا بفضل تلك الطرق العثور على عدد هائل من الحواتم التي لم تكن معروفة سابقا. 
وأكد العلماء أنه رغم تلك الاكتشافات ""الكبيرة"" التي توصلوا لها إلا أنه لا يزال أمامهم الكثير لاكتشافه، لكن ما توصلوا إليه في بحوثهم الأخيرة سيساعد كثيرا على التعمق في فهم آلية عمل الجهاز المناعي، وسيعطي فرصة لتطوير أساليب جديدة في علاج أمراض المناعة الذاتية.

Getting embroiled in Syria, terrorism, and conflict with Russia devastated one of Turkey's principal industries Donate! The author is a Ph.D. student and teaching assistant at the School of Politics, University of Leeds, UK Frankenstein is on the loose... The demons unleashed from Pandora’s box accompany him taunting the earth...A chaos, unseen since WW2, has been decimating the humanity. The anguish in human institutions, the agony of the social and political establishment is echoed on global basis. The Middle East has been the epicentre of this devastating storm with Turkey, a once stable and secure nation, being drawn deeply into this unprecedented vortex of despair. Turkish tourism has descended into turmoil amidst this unrivalled crisis as well. Wave of armed attacks juxtaposed with the still raw trauma of failed coup d’état coinciding with the high season lacerated tourism. According to analyst Wolfango Piccoli of the consulting firm Teneo Intelligence: ‘Taking into account direct and indirect income, tourism accounts for as much as 12 percent (or $96 billion) of Turkey’s GDP and tourist arrivals were down 45 percent compared to 2015’. This is the sharpest drop ever since 1998. However, is it right to put the blame at the gate of regional problems and terrorism only for this bleak situation? Terrorism and a series of unforgiveable domestic and foreign policy blunders such as meddling in Syria, dispute with Russia, failure to acknowledge the threat posed by the rising wave of Jihadism could obviously be held accountable to a considerable extent yet Turkey has a more challenging issue: the image! What actually deterred the Western vacationers from coming to Turkey is not only the fear of terrorism but also anger at the inflammatory politics of Turkey. Germany issued a travel advisory to its citizens not only for terrorism but also for the pathetic fact that those visiting Turkey should not make public statements against the Turkish state whilst Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders warned that the Netherlands cannot guarantee the safety of citizens travelling to Turkey if they have been ‘critical of Turkish leaders.’ German newspaper Die Zeit reported that flow of tourist to Turkey has shown ‘signs of continuous abating’ due to Erdogan’s clampdown on the opposition media and a series of terrorist attacks in the country. “Erdogan’s foreign policy has been an unmitigated disaster for Turkey, but his autocratic domestic tendencies at home have also led to alienation,” said Jonathan Schanzer, vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank. Vienna airport displays news at a screen saying “Turkey allows sex with children under the age of 15” upon a story released by Austrian tabloid Kronen (country’s largest newspaper), that Turkey’s constitutional court to cancel a law that designated all sexual activities with children under the age of 15 as abuse. Thomas Schnoell, a spokesman for the Austrian foreign ministry, confirmed the ambassador had been summoned by Ankara. In a fury, he said “this is for us a matter of freedom of the press.” This allegation could be the truth or a fallacy... whatever it was, yet it caused a massive row, led to ‘Don’t Go to Turkey Campaign’ and tarnished the image of Turkey immensely across Europe voicing concerns about Islamization of the state. An outstanding report titled as ‘Tourism as Politics: Turkey’ published in 2014 by professor Thomas Clayton at Middle East Institute, George Washington University seems to have prognosticated the current plight of Turkish tourism. Clayton posits that ‘ the recent domestic and international political upheavals hold both risks and opportunities for Turkey’s tourism potential. The domestic political controversy over the Gezi Park protests and the government’s response have also tarnished Turkey’s image in a way that officials are quick to dismiss but may prove extremely detrimental to Turkey’s long term plans to become a major international tourist destination.’ Admittedly, terrorism has become a hot potato in the hands of Turkey and the survival of Turkish tourism relies not on entirely combating terrorism and resolving the crisis in the perception of its safety. It is actually more linked with ‘re-construction of its image’ on the global stage. The impressions left at home and abroad have impacted tourism antagonistically. Tourism is a crucial part of understanding, and a creative way to analyze, domestic and foreign policy as well. There is an urgent need for a political reset and long-overdue reforms to embrace the political and legal stability and to strengthen the democracy in the foreseeable future. Considering that boosting halal tourism is not the solution, the abrupt restoration of ties with Europe and other estranged regional powers is therefore of paramount significance for a quick recovery of tourism. 
Consequently, the golden segment of Turkey’s economy could be rejuvenated if the relentless and short-sighted policies are disposed of and above all a dovish rather than a hawkish approach is adopted towards domestic and international crises.

In addition, over 100 aircraft have been scrambled as part of the drill Originally appeared at RT Over 100 fighter jets, long-range bombers and combat helicopters have been scrambled at their bases across Russia and six post-Soviet states as the allies prepare to test their integrated air defense system in a massive military exercise. 
More than 130 command and control centers have been put on alert in Russia and six former Soviet republics – Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan – the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. 
All the countries contribute to the integrated air defense system overseen by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) – an alliance of former Soviet republics that emerged after the collapse of the USSR. 
The large-scale military exercise is to train high-readiness forces in dealing with “airspace violations, including by hijacked aircraft” as well as “assisting crews of aircraft in distress,” the ministry added. 
Some 100 aircraft, including Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 fighter jets, Su-24 and Su-34 bombers, as well as Su-25 ground attack jets and combat helicopters provided by the allies, are expected to take part in the drill. 
Troops from electronic warfare and surface-to-air missile units are also participating. 
The exercise started at 8am Moscow time with Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 aircraft given the roles of aggressor. The planes, simulating an adversary force, were spotted over Eastern European and Central Asian airspaces, the Russian military said. 
All units are being coordinated from a Russian Air Force command center located outside Moscow. 
The joint CIS air defense system, established in 1995, currently focuses on protecting the ex-Soviet countries’ airspace as well as providing air or missile strike early warnings and coordinated responses. 
Russia contributes the bulk of the system’s early warning and air defense capacities, with short- and long-range radar stations monitoring the area. 
Notably, the system does not have a single commander. It is collectively controlled by the chiefs of the air defense forces of the member states themselves. 
Bilateral air defense systems between Russia and its neighbors have also been established in recent years. Last December, an air defense agreement between Russia and Armenia was signed by the two countries’ defense ministers, Sergey Shoigu and Seyran Oganyan, respectively. 
In 2013 Moscow signed a separate treaty on a joint regional air defense system with Kazakhstan. Russian and Belarusian anti-aircraft missile forces have already been unified into an integrated system designed to contain any security threats in the European theater.

A hot war is not going to break out after Nov. 8th - thanks to shrewd moves and preparation by Moscow Originally appeared at Sputnik 
Cold War 2.0 has reached unprecedented hysterical levels. And yet a hot war is not about to break out – before or after the November 8 US presidential election. 
From the Clinton (cash) machine – supported by a neocon/neoliberalcon think tank/media complex – to the British establishment and its corporate media mouthpieces, the Anglo-American, self-appointed “leaders of the free world” are racking up demonization of Russia and “Putinism” to pure incandescence. 
And yet a hot war is not about to break out – before or after the November 8 US presidential election. So many layers of fear and loathing in fact veil no more than a bluff. Let’s start with the Russian naval task force in Syria, led by the officially designated “heavy aircraft-carrying cruiser” Admiral Kuznetsov, which will be stationed in the eastern Mediterranean at least until February 2017, supporting operations against all strands of Salafi-jihadism. 
The Admiral Kuznetsov is fully equipped with anti-ship, air defense, artillery and anti-submarine warfare systems – and can defend itself against a vast array of threats, unlike NATO vessels. 
Predictably, NATO is spinning with alarm that “all of the Northern Fleet”, along with the Baltic Fleet, is on the way to the Mediterranean. Wrong; it’s only part of the Northern Fleet, and the Baltic Fleet ships are not going anywhere. The heart of the matter is that when the capabilities of this Russian naval task force are matched with the S-300/S-400 missile systems already deployed in Syria, Russia is now de facto rivaling the firepower of the US Sixth Fleet. 
To top it off, as this comprehensive military analysis makes clear, Russia has “basically made their own no-fly zone over Syria”; and a US no-fly zone, viscerally promoted by Hillary Clinton, “is now impossible to achieve.” 
That should be more than enough to put into perspective the impotence transmuted into outright anger exhibited by the Pentagon and its neocon/neoliberalcon vassals. 
Add to it the outright war between the Pentagon and the CIA in the Syrian war theatre, where the Pentagon backs the YPG Kurds, who are not necessarily in favor of regime change in Damascus, while the CIA backs further weaponizing of “moderate”, as in al-Qaeda-linked and/or infiltrated, “rebels”. Compounding the trademark Obama administration Three Stooges school of foreign policy, American threats have flown more liberally than Negan’s skull-crushing bloody baton in the new season of The Walking Dead. 
Pentagon head Ash Carter, a certified neocon, has threatened “consequences”, as in “potential” strikes against Syrian Arab Army (SAA) forces to “punish the regime” after the Pentagon itself broke the Kerry-Lavrov ceasefire. President Obama took some time off weighing his options. And in the end, he backed off. 
So it will be up for the virtually elected – by the whole US establishment — Hillary Clinton to make the fateful decision. She won’t be able to go for a no-fly zone – because Russia is already doing it. And if she decides to “punish the regime”, Moscow already telegraphed, via Russia’s Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov, there will definitely be “consequences” for imposing a “shadow” hot war. 
Sun Tzu doesn’t do first-strike 
Washington, of course, reserves for itself a “first-strike” nuclear capability, which Hillary Clinton fully supports (Donald Trump does not, and for that he’s also demonized). If we allow the current hysteria to literally go nuclear, then we must consider the matter of the S-500 anti-missile system – which effectively seals Russia's air space; Moscow won’t admit it on the record because that would unleash a relentless arms race. 
A US intel source with close connections to the Masters of the Universe but at the same time opposed to Cold War 2.0 as “counter-productive”, adds the necessary nuance: “The United States has lost the arms race, indulging in trillions of dollars of worthless and endless wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and now is no longer a global power as it cannot defend itself with its obsolete missiles, THAAD, Patriot and Aegis Land Based Ballistic Defense System, against Russian ICBMs, even as the Russians have sealed their airspace. The Russians may be as much as four generations ahead of the US.” 
Moreover, in the deep recesses of shadow war planning, the Pentagon knows, and the Russian Defense Ministry also knows, that in the event some 
Dr. Strangelove launched a nuclear preemptive strike against Russia, the Russian population would be protected by their defensive missile systems – as well as nuclear bomb shelters in major cities. Warnings on Russian television have not been idle; the population would know where to go in the – terrifying — event of nuclear war breaking out. 
Needless to add, the ghastly possibility of US nuclear first-strike turns all these WWII-style NATO war games in Eastern Europe into a pile of meaningless propaganda stunts. 
So how did Moscow plan for it all? According to the US intel source, “they took out almost all the military budget from their stated federal budget, lulling the West into thinking that Russia could not afford a massive military buildup and there was nothing to fear from Russia as they were finished as a world power. 
The [stated] military budget was next to nothing, so there was nothing to worry about as far as the CIA was concerned. If Putin showed publicly his gigantic military buildup, the West could have taken immediate remedial actions as they did in 2014 by crashing the oil price.” 
The bottom line then would reveal the Pentagon as totally unprepared for a hot war – even as it threatens and bluffs Russia now on a daily basis; “As Brzezinski has pointed out, if this is the case it means the US has ceased to be a global power. The US may continue to bluff, but those that ally with them will have nowhere to go if that bluff is called, as it is being now called in Syria.” 
The US intel source is adamant that “one of the greatest military buildups in history has taken place right under the nose of the Russian Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina and the Russian Ministry of Finance while the CIA awaits what they think will be the inevitable Russia collapse. 
The CIA will be waiting forever and eternity for Russia to collapse. This MGB maneuver is sheer genius. And demonstrates that the CIA, which is so drowned by data inputs that they cannot connect the dots on anything, must be completely reorganized. In addition, the entire procurement system of the United States military must also be reorganized as it cannot ever keep up if new weapon programs as the F-35 take twenty years to develop and then are found obsolete before they even enter service. The Russians have a five-year development program for each new weapons system and they are far ahead of us in every key area.” 
If this analysis is correct, it goes against even the best and most precise Russian estimates, according to which military potential may be strong, asymmetrically, but still much inferior to US military might. 
Well-informed Western analysts know that Moscow never brags about military buildups – and has mastered to a fault the element of surprise. Much more than calling a bluff, it’s Moscow’s Sun Tzu tactics that are really rattling loudmouth Washington. Did you enjoy this article? - Consider helping us!

""So why not give everyone a free day, dress everyone in Boy Scout outfits and make them march along the Pennsylvania Avenue singing songs about the Great Mother of the Nation. Finally, North Korea would meet its match."" Hooray! (Click to enlarge) The author is an Associate Professor of Slavic Languages at Brown University, an American Ivy League university. People are justifiably frightened by the prospect of Hillary Clinton re-entering the White House, as if her first stay wasn’t bad enough. To all those who think that her warmongering would result in military confrontation with Russia, and her cozy relationships with bankers would lead to economic collapse, I would like to offer something to cheer about. # 10 America is the country of émigrés, of people who were given a second chance after they landed here. So Hillary’s second coming to the White House, would be the source of endless inspirational stories for the poor suckers belonging to the 99% and who rely on the crumbs that 1% drops to them from their table. Never give up, there is always a second chance at joining this coveted table. # 9 Hillary’s victory would spawn a great new industry for senior citizens. Rather than looking forward to playing bingo or taking cruises, any senior could aspire to become president. What a great area of possibilities! I can imagine courses opening all over the country on such diverse subjects as to how to open a foundation and take bribes legally; how to negotiate with lobbyists, how to laugh demonically and sarcastically, how to erase your emails, and how to forget bad things that you’ve done. Not sure the seniors would pay for this last group of courses, but worth trying anyway. # 8 With Hillary in the White House, the whole world would celebrate her reception of several Nobel Prizes simultaneously. Judging by the eagerness with which they responded to President Obama’s promises of peace, it is hard to imagine Nobel Prize committees failing to respond to Hillary’s winning ways. Consequently, we will be able to rejoice at Hillary’s Nobel prizes for Peace (in the Middle East in particular), for fiction (her whole life is one big fantasy); for mathematics (for inventing computer algorithms that either destroy emails, or attributes them to the hacking Russians), for chemistry (for inventing the coating, that makes Teflon look fragile and crumbling), and for physics (for constructing this missile shield that would enable her to create unopposed no-fly zones any place she wants). This latter prize she might share with the great chief of Pentagon and physicist in his own right, Mr. Ashton Carter. # 7 Hillary’s success would result in a new arms race with Russia, providing endless amounts of jobs for students of Russian, since there will be a need to discover all the mischief of Russians and therefore beef up all the seventeen agencies that, according to Hillary, keep on spying on Russians. Furthermore, with Russians being what they are, seventeen agencies are hardly enough. There should be at least 1001. I can easily foresee the brightest future for all Slavic Departments. A bit of self-serving, I agree, but after all, with Hillary we are entering a new “self-serving-is-good” age. # 6 Hillary would also unleash a new politically correct language onto the world. Just the other day, as I was booking hotel room, I was asked about my gender. And there were only two options to choose. What a disgrace! With Hillary in the White House, all the great students of Ivy League Universities – and they are the only ones who can remember and pontificate on all thirty one gender identities introduced by political correctness --would find fantastic employment advising various companies, agencies, even countries, on this subject. And this is only the beginning. Think about the great employment opportunities for those who can distinguish and label all thirty-one types of terrorists currently fighting in Syria. The State Department, which already employs seventy thousand people, would have to be drastically expanded to accommodate such experts. # 5 The Saudis could buy all Trump’s Hotels, including the one that is supposed to be next to the White House; consequently, they could negotiate with Hillary directly, without leaving any paper or internet trace. So, there won’t be any need for Wiki-leaks emails, and other bothersome documents, all of which seem to distract the country from its main task. The task indicated to all of us by Hillary’s one-time rival, Bernie Sanders, who after he announced, “people are sick of hearing about these damn emails ,” proceeded, without further ado, to lick Hillary’s behind. And so did all his followers who are now cheering for the rest of us to do the same. # 4 A Hillary victory would guarantee the continuity of the same people in such positions of power as Pentagon, State Department, Treasury, CIA, or Senate. Who needs unnecessary disruption that comes with the change of various leaders? With Republicans switching to Hillary, it is high time that we modify the elections in general, to cement the elite’s hold on power. They are obviously very good for the country; otherwise, we would not be voting for the same people again and again. So why not give everyone a free day, dress everyone in Boy Scout outfits and make them march along the Pennsylvania Ave singing songs about the Great Mother of the Nation. Finally, North Korea would meet its match. Who are those skeptics who say that Kim is a serious threat to US? To their Kims we offer our Clintons, to their party we offer our party, to their elections --our elections, to their meager amount of nukes we offer our full arsenal of nukes. So eat your kimchi, Mr. Kim and go back to jailing your opponents. # 3 This small step for mankind will be a giant step for all women in the world. Never mind the previous great examples of female presidents and national leaders. They were not Americans, and therefore cannot possibly serve as role models. With Hillary, every woman could look at her daughter and say: “Don’t worry. One of these days, you’ll marry an ambitious young man from provinces, and you’ll do everything in your abilities to help him succeed. And after he enjoys all the perks that come with his success, while you continue to serve him with devotion and loyalty, you’ll get your second chance. Just be patient!” What a great inspiration to all the young women of this nation! # 2 The banking industry would experience a real renaissance. New York would be renamed New Wall Street, since only bankers could afford to live there. Unopposed and unregulated, they would become truly creative, selling us mortgages for the use of air, sea, rain, stars, and sky. And putting all their profits to good use, they will make sure to provide us with perfect replacements for any retiring party apparatchik. # 1 Warmongering industries, Silicon Valley, and the entire state of California would be given a chance to compete with bankers in terms of power and money. With the shortage of water, the state is slowly turning into a desert. So inventing gadgets for the military, and testing nukes in California deserts, would be a fantastic solution. And in terms of the rest of the country, frankly, who cares about them. Their task is to pay taxes, buy the new financial vehicles invented in New York, play with the new gadgets invented in California, and keep on voting for Hillary, our Big Sister, who never sleeps, devising ways to protect us from those pesky North Koreans and Russians. So it is high time for people who inhabit this little patch of land squeezed between California and New York, to all those formerly known as “the great unwashed,” but rebranded recently as “deplorables” it is high time for you all to give up on your sexist, gun-toting, racist ways, and begin to rejoice in the fact that in this wonderful land of yours and theirs everything is for a woman… And her name is Hillary.

As fighting resumes in Aleppo following a brief ceasefire — and as Russia’s largest naval fleet to sail since the Cold War steams down the English Channel on its way to the western coast of Syria — it’s important, in times when most of the focus is being drawn to one point, to step back and look at the whole board. 
Yes, what’s happening in Aleppo is a tragedy. Civilians, women, and children are being blasted out of existence as two superpowers back opposing sides in a proxy war for regional dominance. Yes, as the Russian fleet nears the Mediterranean Sea, tensions will undoubtedly escalate for a number of nations with ties to the Syrian conflict. 
But President Vladimir Putin’s moves regarding Aleppo are far from his only ones worth noting of late. 
Take Turkey, for instance. Last week, Underground Reporter posited the idea that Turkey, due to its deteriorating relations with the United States and its strengthening cooperation with Russia, has, in effect, become the military wild card in the Middle East. Cited as evidence of deepening Russian-Turkish ties was the fact that the two countries have just signed a deal to build a pipeline from Turkey to Ukraine, which would then supply natural gas to Europe. 
Turkey, which is north of Syria, shares much of its southern and all of its eastern border with the Mediterranean Sea. A good portion of Syria’s western border also runs into the Mediterranean, and it’s in those waters where Russian vessels, already hovering there, await the arrival of the aircraft carrier-led fleet now pushing through the English Channel. 
All this fits nicely into a narrative that only focuses on what’s happening in Aleppo. But one need only glance at a map to see, using nothing but the eyes and common sense, just how much more is actually taking place right now. 
In mid-October, it was reported that, for the first time ever, Russia and Egypt would conduct joint military drills. This followed news that Russia will sell attack helicopters to the North African nation and invest billions in Egyptian infrastructure. These items, along with the fact that Egypt is eager to be re-granted Russian tourism rights for its citizens after recent bad blood between the countries, lead one to the logical conclusion that Egypt has every incentive to cooperate with Russia going forward. 
Egypt, in case you’re not looking at that map, is directly across the Mediterranean Sea from Turkey. 
This means when the Russian fleet reaches the Mediterranean — whether the intent is to park in those waters and bombard Aleppo, as some believe, or merely to project Russian might to the world, as others suggest — it will be flanked by friendlies on three sides. Turkey to the north, Syrian to the east, and Egypt to the south. 
This is not a bad position to be in if you’re looking to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkey to Ukraine. Turkey, incidentally, shares its northern border with the Black Sea, which in turn shares its southern border with Ukraine. And the Black Sea, as those who’ve followed the Ukrainian situation in recent years well know, is swarming with Russian warships. 
So, in the bigger picture — assuming Turkey will eventually fully embrace the Russian sphere and that Egypt, as it’s highly incentivized to do, embraces its new role as a Russian satellite — Putin has protected himself quite deftly from those in the West who’ll inevitably, no matter what the fleet does once it arrives, accuse Putin of aggression. 
Turkey and Egypt are both formerly staunch U.S. allies, after all, and there’s been no official severing of ties, or even hintsof such, with those nations. So Putin, thanks largely to the West’s own hegemonic maneuvering, has a lot of room to operate in terms of deals and cooperation — both militarily and economically. 
In any case, the facts present a narrative — albeit a theoretical one — that isn’t being discussed. Putin, as we speak, may be implementing the first phases of an effort to secure a nice straight shot from Turkey to Ukraine for the long-desired Turkish Stream pipeline.

It’s also been rumored that the former First Lady may have used an ear piece at one of the debates, giving her a significant advantage.
Last week footage of the final Presidential debate begain circling the internet and showed that Clinton may have been using some sort of screen at her podium. While many dismissed this as a lighting effect, an investigation by Piper McGowin at The Daily Sheeple suggests that Hillary may have actually been using some sort of tablet device .
The following video will leave little doubt that something just wasn’t right at the last debate. As you’ll see, Hillary, who claims she was merely taking notes, was actually reading directly off of the podium, almost as if someone was feeding her answers and bullet points.
Moreover, and quite damning, the notes Hillary was supposedly taking were were being written down with a pen that didn’t have a tip on it . So, either she wasn’t taking notes, or, she was using a stylus on an electronic device.

Editor’s Comment: Of course everyone knew, deep down, that Obama was fully aware of Hillary’s private emails, but now there is proof that the campaigns sought to cover up and clean up the evidence to it. Team Hillary went so far as to use bleach bit, a ridiculously thorough way of erasing one’s digital footprint. Before she even takes office, she is embroiled in a scandal many magnitudes bigger than Watergate… and yet… nothing. 
No one falls on their sword; no one drops out; no one is held accountable. It seems that “Teflon” will out-survive even the cockroaches and nuclear wars… 
Can all the media spin and vote rigging really hold all this together? Can the FBI get away with looking the other way, and still pretend to uphold a nation of laws? Will the American people accept her “victory” and go on about their daily lives? 
The Smoking Gun: Cheryl Mills Tells Podesta “We Need To Clean This Up – Obama Has Emails From Her” 
by Tyler Durden
Recall that in a March 2015 interview with CBS, just after the NYT reported of Hillary’s use of a private email server, president Obama told the American public he had only learned about Hillary’s “unusual” arrangement from the press.
As we further reminded readers one month ago, CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante asked Mr. Obama when he learned about her private email system after his Saturday appearance in Selma, Alabama. “ The same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,” the president told Plante. “ The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived ,” Mr. Obama said. “I’m glad that Hillary’s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.”

Unfortunately, the “transparency” of the Obama administration was severely tarnished in late September , when in the FBI’s interview notes with Huma Abedin released by the FBI it was first revealed that Obama had used a pseudonymous email account: “Once informed that the sender’s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: ‘How is this not classified?'” the report says. “Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president’s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.”
To be sure, this was not definitive evidence that Obama was aware of Hillary’s email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the Clinton campaign.
That changed today, however, when in the latest Podesta dump we learn that in an email from Cheryl Mills to John Podesta, the Clinton aide upon learning what Obama had just said…
I have some questions here pic.twitter.com/ufkeoZCx2m 
— Katherine Miller (@katherinemiller) March 7, 2015 

… countered with something quite stunning:
we need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov That, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the Clinton campaign.

As a further reminder, Politico previously reported that the State Department had refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers cited the “presidential communications privilege,” a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. It is therefore unknown what the president’s “alternative” email account was, or who hosted it.
This also explains why in a prior Wikileak, Podesta told Mills in an email titled “Special Category” that she thinks “ we should hold emails to and from potus? That’s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will. ” Mills did not respond by email.
The Clinton-Obama emails were turned over to the State Department, which later announced it would not release them.
* * *
So just how did Mills and Podesta “clean up” the fact that Obama lied to the American people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect Hillary Clinton.
What we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between March 25-31, just a couple of weeks after Mills said “we need to clean this up,” Bleachbit was used to wipe Hillary’s private server clean. But of course, that is purely a coincidence.
Since we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of US government, or as Cheryl Mills dubbed it a “clean up”, perhaps it is time for the State Department to unveil just what was said between the president and the Clinton campaign?

While most people are rightly focused on FBI head James Comey, there’s another person who needs to be investigated far more closely. That person is deputy director of the FBI. Andrew McCabe. 
Submitted by Michael Krieger : 
A theme I’ve been focused on for the past several weeks, relates to the growing anger from within the ranks of current and former FBI agents over the agency’s questionable and shady investigation into the email practices of Hillary Clinton. For example, in last week’s post, Internal Anger at the FBI Over Clinton Investigation Continues to Grow , I noted: 
“This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,” an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision. “We talk about it in the office and don’t know how Comey can keep going.” 
DiGenova told WMAL radio’s Drive at Five last week, “People are starting to talk. They’re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away.” 
He explained, “It’s not. People inside the bureau are furious. They are embarrassed. They feel like they are being led by a hack but more than that that they think he’s a crook. They think he’s fundamentally dishonest. They have no confidence in him. The bureau inside right now is a mess.” 
He added, “The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk.” 
While most people are rightly focused on FBI head James Comey, there’s another person who needs to be investigated far more closely due to his ties to cash from long-time Clinton ally and Virginia Governor, Terry McAuliffe. That person is deputy director of the FBI. Andrew McCabe. 
The Wall Street Journal reports: 
The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s email use. 
Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe’s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI. 
The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe’s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe’s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort. 
The FBI said in a statement that during his wife’s campaign Mr. McCabe “played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails.” 
FBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events. 
Mr. McCabe’s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn’t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife’s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn’t part of the email probe, officials said. 
Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons’ political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton’s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple’s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature. 
Indeed, McAuliffe is also the guy who made it clear over the summer that Hillary Clinton’s “private position” on the TPP was to support it. This was discussed in July’s post: Nobody Knows Who’s Paying for the Privately Funded Democratic National Convention . 
Dr. McCabe announced her candidacy in March 2015, the same month it was revealed that Mrs. Clinton had used a private server as secretary of state to send and receive government emails, a disclosure that prompted the FBI investigation. 
At the time the investigation was launched in July 2015, Mr. McCabe was running the FBI’s Washington, D.C., field office, which provided personnel and resources to the Clinton email probe. 
At the end of July 2015, Mr. McCabe was promoted to FBI headquarters and assumed the No. 3 position at the agency. In February 2016, he became FBI Director James Comey’s second-in-command. 
As deputy director, Mr. McCabe was part of the executive leadership team overseeing the Clinton email investigation, though FBI officials say any final decisions on that probe were made by Mr. Comey, who served as a high-ranking Justice Department official in the administration of George W. Bush. 
Mr. McAuliffe has been under investigation for months by the FBI’s Washington field office, a probe that includes an examination of donations made on behalf of a Chinese businessman, according to people familiar with the matter. His lawyers have denied any wrongdoing and said the investigation is seeking to determine if Mr. McAuliffe may have violated a law requiring people to register as agents of a foreign entity. 
Just further evidence that the U.S. has been transformed into little more than a glorified Banana Republic.

The Trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the NWO globalists. 

Submitted by James Hall : 
If not now, WHEN? Only the most dedicated Totalitarian Collectivist would want to keep the NWO in power. Those who are so dim-witted to believe that the governance elites are legitimate rulers, exercising moral authority are so ignorant and illiterate that they deserve the fate of sheep taken to the slaughter. The Sheeple designation is apt for a society mired in a distorted reality of serfdom. 
The New World Order moved from a century’s old scheme to enslave humanity into a consolidated “ international community ”, when the central banksters organized the Bank for International Settlements, with the adoption of the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, the reorganization of nation states with the end of World War II, the creation of the globalist United Nations and the establishment of the centralized bureaucracy of the European Union. 
The Trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the NWO globalists. 
It is because of this opposition to the transnational ruling despots that the vicious, deceitful and unending assault on Trump and his followers has been unleashed, since real meaningful change cannot be allowed that would reverse the systematic destruction of Western Civilization.

DONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER 
What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between myself and the American voter – and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington. Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. 
On the same day, I will begin taking the following 7 actions to protect American workers: 
 FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 
 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership 
 THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator 
 FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately 
 FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars’ worth of job producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. 
 SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward 
 SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America’s water and environmental infrastructure 
Additionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: 
 FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama 
 SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States 
 THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities 
 FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won’t take them back 
 FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. 
Next, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. Restoring National Security Act.

Publishing the entire list of all these positive measures, which challenge the elitist consortium of a criminal syndicate that impose a neo-feudal enslavement of humanity, documents the essence of the Trump vow of revolutionary nonviolent combat against the forces of satanic evil. 
The ironic symbolism of presenting this restoration of national greatness at the site of the historic betrayal of the original American Revolution, one must not forget that Abraham Lincoln embarked upon the initial destruction of the legitimate States’ Right essence that created the country. 
This apocalyptic step, set into motion the underpinnings of a global empire of which, America was never intended to pursue. Let’s hope that Donald Trump can rectify some of the damage done to the individual rights embodied in the Declaration of Independence.

Submitted by Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante : 
We have been very, very suspicious of Donald Trump since he began his political run. 
Many believed he was an outsider who was our “only hope” to tame the US federal government beast. But it has become very clear he is not. 
First, Wikileaks showed that Killary herself actually approved Trump to be her competitor . According to an email sent from an assistant at the Clinton campaign, Hillary was aware that Trump was going to run before the political process was fully underway. 
Clinton advised the mainstream media to push his legitimacy as a “pied piper” candidate because she realized, after looking at the poll numbers, that she wouldn’t stand a chance at winning the presidency against any of the establishment republicans without making them “pied pipers” – it just so happened that Donald was the easiest to play the role considering his long history of friendship with the Clintons. 
In addition, the mainstream media was more than complicit in creating a narrative that the 2016 presidential elections were about Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump from the get go. 
But, barely reported in the media, was that after the 3rd presidential debate, Clinton and Trump went out for a night on the town together… and where they went is of great interest. 
They went to an annual Jesuit function which is usually full of New World Order types. 
THE JESUITS 
One of the more interesting things that occurred right at the end of the Jubilee year in early October, was that the Jesuits installed a new Superior General, with the date to commence being actually at midnight on the end of Jubilee. 
We found this interesting because there is plenty of evidence that the Jesuits are at least one major arm of what you can call the illuminati. 
In fact, the Jesuits were founded in Spain by what various reports call “crypto Jews” – those who are Jewish but pretending to be Catholic. Certainly at that time in Spain it was safer not to be a Jew. 
Even Wikipedia, which wouldn’t recognize a conspiracy if it were directly presented by its participants has this to say about the Jesuits: 
… In the first 30 years of the existence of the Society of Jesus there were many Jesuit conversos (Catholic-convert Jews) including the second Father General Diego Lainez … The original founder Ignatius … said that he, “would take it as a special grace from our Lord to come from Jewish lineage.” 
At the beginning of the Al Smith dinner party after Cardinal Dolan was introduced, a joke was even made by a speaker that “everyone in attendance is doing their part in supporting their charitable efforts and that it couldn’t be done without the support of many of the other devoted “Catholics” on stage like Henry Kissinger, Howard Rubenstein, and Mort Zuckerman” – all of whom are obviously Jewish so this remark was naturally met with a lot of laughter… 
In fact, an extraordinary amount of controversy swirls around Jesuits. They are said to constitute the “Black Church” and thus adhere to the same Satanic religion as the world’s elite bankers supposedly hold. 
The leader of the Jesuit order is commonly recognized in conspiratorial circles as the “Black Pope” whose signature staff is a crooked cross. Historically, the Jesuit Order has been seen as one that shirks no crime in expanding the power of the Church. 
Lest this sound entirely outrageous, one must note that the Jesuits are, for instance, the inventors of concentration camps, which they established in Paraguay in order to incarcerate and then torture the native indians of the area. 
But the litany of attributed Jesuit evil is even darker than that according to those who believe in the order’s continued malicious pursuit. The supposed founder of the Bavarian-based Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, was a Jesuit. 
In fact, the order is reputed to have been deeply involved in the Illuminati’s initial expansion, and chances are it is still deeply involved. 
One more thing that highlights the evil of the Jesuits is their extreme oath of induction which all superiors must take in order to be elevated to the higher rungs of the organization. This is taken from the book Subterranean Rome by Carlos Didier, translated from the French, and published in New York in 1843 and reads in part, 
“…promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants’ heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus…” 
One of the most poignant quotes regarding the malevolence of the Jesuits comes from Marquis de LaFayette 1757-1834; who was a French statesman and general who served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. 
His quote is as follows: 
“It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.” 
THE BIG BASH 
When evaluating Jesuit behavior and influence, please keep in mind that both Donald Trump and Hillary’s VP, Tim Kaine, are Jesuit educated. And it should be of GREAT interest, therefore, that practically on the eve of the US election, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton partied the night away at a Jesuit function that included such prominent Jesuit-trained attendees as Henry Kissinger. 
Not only did the two not look like sworn enemies… they looked like two star crossed lovers going to their first prom. 
We have long held to our stance that Killary will be the next President of the US. The amount of vote rigging, murders and shenanigans to even get her to where she is so far has been tremendous… and it won’t stop. 
That said, if by some fluke, and the Diebold machines malfunction or people in the US wake up slightly and Donald Trump gets elected… it is pretty clear they are on the same team and, as we’ve said previously, nothing major will change. 
So, if you were hoping that this election could change things in the US… get over that hope right now. It might change things, but only for the much, much worse. 
This charade is being played right in front of everyone’s eyes and most do not understand what is happening or why jokes like the “Catholic” joke is actually funny to these elite people. 
They are laughing at the peasants stupidity and lack of understanding, not because the men mentioned are Jews… anyone with half a brain knows that. 
But while they laugh, we’ll be laughing all the way to the bank ourselves. Just because these sick people are formulating diabolical plans to enslave humanity doesn’t mean we can’t profit from their planned chaos. It’s better than sitting back in ignorance and making nothing. 
Our analysis of these elite’s occult timelines which began with the Shemitah and culminated with the Jubilee, have helped us to accumulate around a 200% collective return on our portfolio in the last year.

A zillion moving parts go into disorders like cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and only a comparative few are known for sure. Researchers believe something called the Epigenome Roadmap a cascade of two dozen papers published last year is gradually changing that. The Roadmap is a catalog of the millions of epigenetic switches that control gene action. It's pretty clear that epigenetics is key to really understanding disease as well as normal human traits. Eventually, that is; nailing down those connections is going to take time. For one thing, disease mutations and other DNA variations, it turns out, are hardly ever where you would expect them to be: in genes that make the proteins that run the show. Ninety percent of disease-related mutations are in the regions of DNA that lie outside those genes, the regulatory regions that control protein-coding gene action. The working hypothesis is that variation in disease susceptibility - or any other trait - depends mostly on subtle differences in the expression of protein-coding genes, which is under epigenetic control. Mutations associated with Alzheimer's disease, in a surprising and immediately practical finding among those new papers, turned out to be active not so much in brain cells, where you might expect activity. Instead, they altered epigenomic activity in cells of the immune system. ""Our results suggest that repression of neural pathways does not represent genetic predisposition, even though it is a hallmark of Alzheimer's,"" senior author Li-Huei Tsai of MIT said in a statement. ""Instead, it may occur as a consequence of environmental factors and aging , and result from interactions with the altered immune pathways."" This was work done in mice, so we don't know for sure that it applies to humans. But it gives scientists a hopeful new target for figuring out how to prevent and treat this devastating disease, which every day grows more urgent in our aging populations. Epigenome researchers also reported advances in asthma and allergy research. They identified more than two dozen genes that regulate IgE, the antibody that provokes allergic reactions. In some people, epigenetic mechanisms interfere with shutting down those genes at the right time. The result is the overproduction of IgE, which triggers asthma attacks. Miriam Moffatt, a senior investigator on the project, said in a statement, ""The genes we identified represent new potential drug targets for allergic diseases as well as biomarkers that may predict which patients will respond to existing expensive therapies."" What is the epigenome? But what is the epigenome anyway? The epigenome is the reason that all your body cells, which started out identical when your mother's fertilized egg began splitting into daughter cells, were able to turn themselves into specialists: brain, liver, heart, skin, etc. The epigenome is the reason identical twins, which have identical genomes, are always different from each other (sometimes very different), grow more different as they age, and often have different diseases. The epigenome is a reason that we humans are utterly unlike chimpanzees, even though our DNA differs very little. The simplest way to think about the epigenome is that it's all about the biochemical switches that turn genes on and off in particular cells at particular times of life. Epigenetics seeks to explain how the environment—what you eat, how your parents treated you, all of your life events and possibly even your ancestors' life events—has made you into you. Those biochemical switches are how nurture shapes nature. Explaining the relationship of the genome and the epigenome at a press conference announcing the papers (all published in Nature and associated journals), study coauthor Manolis Kellis of MIT said, ""All our cells have a copy of the same book [the genome], but they're all reading different chapters , bookmarking different pages, and highlighting different paragraphs and words."" The bookmarks Kellis spoke of are biochemical mechanisms that change the behavior of genetic material without changing any DNA sequences. The two best known and most studied of these mechanisms are DNA methylation and histone modification. Histones are the proteins DNA is wrapped tightly around. Histone modifications usually involve attachment of an acetyl group (CH3CO.) Acetylation helps tightly coiled DNA unwind a bit, making genes easier to get to and turn on. In methylation, methyl groups (CH3) stick to DNA and usually suppress gene expression. That's what was going on in the asthma study described above. Among asthma patients, the researchers found low methylation at 36 places in 34 genes. Low methylation meant the genes didn't get turned off. Hence overproduction of IgE antibodies that trigger asthma attacks. For the National Institutes of Health's Roadmap Epigenomics Program, hundreds of scientists around the world studied epigenetic events in more than 100 types of body tissues from healthy adults, fetal cells, and stem cells, assembling reference epigenomes for each one. These epigenetic patterns characteristic of each tissue can be compared to other samples, including tissue from people with dozens of diseases. Examples: type 1 diabetes, Crohn's disease, high blood pressure, inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimer's disease. Comparisons permit scientists to see epigenetic abnormalities in particular cell types. Naysaying and cautions Not everybody thinks the epigenome project is awesome. An anonymous scientist blogging at Homolog.us - Bioinformatics complained, "" Nothing managed to derail this expensive boondoggle over the last four years, including powerful critics of the scientific principle behind it, fraud allegation against the leader, public humiliation of its sister project ENCODE, NIH cost-cutting and protest of the scientists, and so on."" As for the idea that diet, toxic exposures, parental behavior, and other lifestyle factors determine health, ""not a single claim is backed by any science. We have gone through many of the relevant studies, and they were often based on poor-quality association studies of 30 or 40 persons and no further study of causal mechanism."" That fulmination is a minority view, and it's not accurate to claim that all epigenetics studies are weak. But it is certainly the case that, despite the hoopla surrounding these papers, realizing gains to human health from research on the epigenome is a long way away. These studies need to be replicated and, in the case of studies done on animals, replicated in humans. But to date, epigenetics findings have been difficult to repeat . Also, epigenetic activity varies throughout the lifespan, and so epigenetic investigations tied to the aging process will be required. Studies of 1000 additional cell type epigenomes are being planned. Kellis, a leader of the Epigenome Roadmap Consortium roundly savaged at Homolog.us, certainly, can be counted a fan of epigenome research. But even his forecast, which is presumably optimistic, predicts that figuring out how one person's epigenome differs from another will take the next decade. Tabitha M.

The footage was released by Facebook user Yossi Cohen on Monday. ""Today at the synagogue in Ben Gurion airport,"" he wrote under the video. They were all members of one Turkish family, according to Breaking Israeli news. They were apparently looking for a place to pray and found a synagogue which was empty. It was just before the holiday of Simchat Torah, a Jewish holiday that marks the end of the annual cycle of public Torah readings and the beginning of a new cycle. Religious Jews do not usually travel on such days. The family used the available Jewish prayer shawls, also known as tallits, as prayer mats. Tallits are shawls traditionally worn over the clothes by religious Jews during prayers. But when the Muslim family realized that they were praying in the synagogue, they ""folded the shawls and explained that they'd just looked for a place to pray,"" a witness told NRG website. According to the Times of Israel , Ben Gurion Airport doesn't provide any facilities for believers of religions other than Judaism. Some Israelis welcomed the act of praying in the synagogue. According to Yehuda Glick, a member of the Knesset, he himself ""prayed in a mosque"" and he said he is ""happy that Muslims prayed in a synagogue."" ""Where is the embarrassment?

More than 130 command and control centers have been put on alert in Russia and six former Soviet republics - Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan - the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. All the countries contribute to the integrated air defense system overseen by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - an alliance of former Soviet republics that emerged after the collapse of the USSR. The large-scale military exercise is to train high-readiness forces in dealing with ""airspace violations, including by hijacked aircraft"" as well as ""assisting crews of aircraft in distress,"" the ministry added. Some 100 aircraft, including Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 fighter jets, Su-24 and Su-34 bombers, as well as Su-25 ground attack jets and combat helicopters provided by the allies, are expected to take part in the drill. Troops from electronic warfare and surface-to-air missile units are also participating. The exercise started at 8am Moscow time with Tu-160, Tu-95MS and Tu-22M3 aircraft given the roles of aggressor. The planes, simulating an adversary force, were spotted over Eastern European and Central Asian airspaces, the Russian military said. All units are being coordinated from a Russian Air Force command center located outside Moscow. The joint CIS air defense system, established in 1995, currently focuses on protecting the ex-Soviet countries' airspace as well as providing air or missile strike early warnings and coordinated responses. Russia contributes the bulk of the system's early warning and air defense capacities, with short- and long-range radar stations monitoring the area. Notably, the system does not have a single commander. It is collectively controlled by the chiefs of the air defense forces of the member states themselves. Bilateral air defense systems between Russia and its neighbors have also been established in recent years.

Israel is not recognized by Iraq, similar to many other Muslim states, and its citizens are not allowed into Iraq. But two major Israeli networks have sent their crews to the battlefield near Mosul and are releasing daily reports from the war. The Israeli coverage from Western Iraq caused concerns among the Arab, specially Iraqi media, and several reporters have approached the two teams to verify how they have entered the country. Hedas Haroush, an Al-Masdar reporter, said that ""the Israelis have used forged European passports to get into Iraq. Ever since the war started numerous reports have surfaced the media claiming that Israeli and Saudi intelligence officers have been sighted among the ISIL terrorists, mostly to help the terrorist cult organize its structure and plan its war strategy.

The first video explained the dark secrets and the hidden connections and organizations the Clinton campaign uses to incite violence at Trump rallies. The second video exposed a diabolical step-by-step voter fraud strategy discussed by top Democratic operatives and showed one key operative admitting that the Democrats have been rigging elections for fifty years. The third video exposed prohibited communications between Hillary Clinton's campaign, the DNC and the non-profit organization Americans United for Change. This latest video breaks down the process of the long-term investigation. In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer's effort . Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. ""First thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I'd like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I'm going to make here is to my money guy and he's going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,"" said the PVA journalist. Creamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the ""donors"" ""niece"" - another Project Veritas Action journalist - was offered an internship with Creamer. In an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor's money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. During that meeting, Creamer spoke about connections he had with Obama and Clinton. After the release of the previous Project Veritas Action videos, Hillary Clinton and her staff tried to distance themselves from Robert Creamer. However, Creamer doubled down about connection with the campaign. ""Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters,"" said Creamer. The more money that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action's $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos. In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC's activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn't been a problem for the month that they had the money. After the former stories were released by Project Veritas Action, Americans United for Change fired Scott Foval and Robert Creamer announced to the DNC that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. James O'Keefe and Project Veritas Action have filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission.

The blueprint for social control employed before and after the crushing of the Attica revolt is the same blueprint used today to keep tens of millions of poor people, especially poor people of color, caged or living in miniature police states. Thompson meticulously documents the innumerable ways the state oppresses the poor by discrediting their voices, turning the press into a megaphone for government propaganda and lies, stoking the negative stereotypes of black people, exalting white supremacy, ruining the lives of people who speak the truth, manipulating the courts and law enforcement, and pressuring state witnesses to lie to obstruct justice. Her book elucidates not only the past but also the present, which, she concedes, is worse. ""America by the early twenty-first century had, in disturbing ways, come to resemble America in the late nineteenth century,"" Thompson writes near the end of her book. ""In 1800 the three-fifths clause gave white voters political power from a black population that was itself barred from voting, and after 2000 prison gerrymandering was doing exactly the same thing in numerous states across the country. After 1865, African American desires for equality and civil rights in the South following the American Civil War led whites to criminalize African American communities in new ways and then sent record numbers of blacks to prison in that region. Similarly, a dramatic spike in black incarceration followed the civil rights movement—a movement that epitomized Attica. And just as businesses had profited from the increased number of Americans in penal facilities after 1870, so did they seek the labor of a growing captive prison population after 1970. In both centuries, white Americans had responded to black claims for freedom by beefing up, and making more punitive, the nation's criminal justice system."" On Sept. 9, 1971, prisoners at the Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York rebelled in the face of intolerable conditions . They were sick of the racist-fueled violence of the white, rural guards; angry at poor medical care and the dearth of vocational and educational programs; underfed (the prison allocated only 63 cents a day to feed a prisoner); unhappy about their mail being censored, or destroyed if it was in Spanish; living in poorly ventilated cells with little or no heat or stifling heat; unable to buy basic commissary items on salaries that averaged 6 cents a day; and tired of being given only one bar of soap and one roll of toilet paper a month and allowed only one shower a week. The uprising was not premeditated. It took place when prisoners, trapped inadvertently by guards in a tunnel that led to the yard, thought they were going to be given another beating by sadistic correction officers. The spontaneous uprising took place ""because ordinary men, poor men, disenfranchised men, and men of color had simply had enough of being treated as less than human, "" Thompson writes. Four hundred fifty prisoners had previously staged a peaceful sit-down strike in the prison's metal shop to protest wages that, as a witness later testified at a New York state hearing, were ""so low that working at Attica [was] tantamount to slavery."" Prisoners had formed committees and sent respectful letters to prison authorities asking them to address their concerns. The requests were largely ignored. Despite authorities' promises that there would be no retribution, those who organized the protests were put in isolation or transferred to other prisons. The callousness of the officials was especially unconscionable in light of the fact that the state had netted huge sums for sales of products made by the prisoners. Comment: The slave labor system continues to this day, forcing inmates to begin hunger strikes and work stoppages to end prison slavery: End prison slavery!' 24,000+ inmates join nationwide jail strike causing lockdowns (VIDEO) After three days of negotiations, in which the prison authorities refused to grant the rebellious prisoners amnesty, 550 New York state troopers, 200 sheriff's deputies and numerous Attica prison guards were issued high-powered weapons, including rifles loaded with especially destructive bullets that expanded on impact, bullets banned in warfare under the Geneva Conventions. The prisoners had no firearms. The assault force members were fed a steady diet of lies and unfounded rumors to stoke their hatred of the prisoners. Black radicals were coming, they were falsely told, to the town of Attica to kidnap white children, a rumor that led to the closing of the schools. Through clouds of CS gas , the assault force stormed the yard, where some 1,200 prisoners held 42 guards and civilian staff members. It unleashed a blizzard of gunfire, shooting 130 people. Twenty-nine prisoners and nine hostages died. (One guard beaten by prisoners in the first moments of the uprising died later in a hospital.) The assault force, which had done all the killings that day, immediately began to hide evidence of its crimes. State officials told the press outside the prison that seven or eight of the hostages had died when the prisoners slit their throats. They claimed that the genitals of one of the guards were cut off and stuffed in his mouth. These reports were untrue, but they dominated the news coverage. Meanwhile, inside the retaken institution, many prisoners were suffering from gunshot wounds that would not be treated for days. Some were stripped and made to run gantlets in which they were beaten by guards with ax handles, baseball bats and rifle butts. Those singled out as the leaders of the rebellion were marked with Xs on their backs, forced to crawl through mud, tortured and in few cases, it appears, executed. New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and the Nixon White House feared that the rebellion presaged armed revolution. The scores of dead and wounded were, for them, a message to the rest of the country— defy us and we will kill you . Today, any citizen who seriously resists the corporate state can expect the same response. Comment: A perfect example: Private security mercenaries pepper spray and sic dogs on Dakota Access Pipeline protesters Thompson writes, ""All of those assembled in the president's office agreed that while the morning's events made a particularly 'gruesome story,' news of the slashings and castration would go a long way toward discrediting America's 'bleeding hearts' like 'the Tom Wicker s of the world.' 'I think this is going to have a hell of a salutary effect on future prison riots,' Nixon said. 'Just as Kent State [the May 4, 1970, shooting by National Guardsmen of unarmed students that left four dead and nine wounded] had a hell of a salutary effect. ... They can talk all they want about force, but that is the purpose of force.' "" The avalanche of government lies permeates the narrative —not a surprise to anyone who has reported on the inner workings of power or spent time in our prisons and marginal communities. There are heroes in the narrative. Their fate, which is almost universally bleak, is also instructive. The prisoner Sam Melville, who was serving an 18-year sentence in Attica for setting off explosives in government buildings to protest the Vietnam War, who taught classes to other inmates and who researched prison operations to show how the institution cruelly exploited prisoner labor for profit, was executed by guards after the uprising, according to other prisoners. So, apparently, was Elliot ""L.D."" Barkley, who was in prison for violating parole by driving without a license and who, although he was only 21, was one of the most articulate spokespeople for the prisoners. Prisoners such as Frank ""Big Black"" Smith, savagely tortured by guards after the uprising, and Bernard ""Shango"" Stroble rose up majestically during the revolt to protect hostages and maintain order, and they fought for justice long after their release from prison. Civil rights attorneys such as Ernie Goodman and William Kunstler came to the prisoners' defense. A few within the governmental system exhibited rare moral courage. Among them were Dr. John Edland of the Monroe County medical examiner's office, who refused to falsify autopsy reports and told the public that the hostages had been killed by state gunfire; Attica guard Michael Smith, who defied his own fraternity to speak the truth about state abuse; and government attorney Malcolm Bell, who exposed the state cover-up of the killings by the state troopers, sheriff's deputies and prison guards. However, most who knew the truth remained silent. Edland was especially singled out for condemnation. He was attacked as incompetent by state officials and called a clown and, although a Republican, a radical left-winger. (State troopers were dispatched to local funeral homes to prevent morticians from informing families of the cause of death of hostages.) Edland received death threats and other hate mail, was shunned by the local community and saw state troopers menacingly idle their automobiles in front of his home. Edland called the day he released the autopsy findings ""the worst day of my life."" When the state decides to isolate, discredit and crush you it has innumerable ways to do so. The press often is manipulated. Employers blacklist you. A gullible population is made to believe the caricature of you as a traitor or an enemy . Such smear campaigns are now directed against Julian Assange, Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. New York State Police Capt. Henry ""Hank"" Williams oversaw the investigation into the 1971 assault. This meant that, in Thompson's words, ""the main investigators of the crimes of Attica were those who may well have committed them."" Williams made sure that ""nothing related to the shooting—shell casings, the weapons themselves—was collected."" No chalk outlines, usually required at a crime scene, were drawn to indicate where the bodies had fallen. No calculations were made regarding bullet trajectories. The yard where the killings took place was cleaned up under Williams' supervision as quickly as possible. Prisoners were threatened with violence or indictment if they refused to incriminate the leaders of the uprising. The goal was not justice; it was to punish and isolate the prisoner leadership and protect law enforcement. ""When strong-arm tactics still proved ineffective,"" Thompson writes concerning one interrogation, ""they switched their approach: should this witness help them, investigators suggested, they would, in turn, help him get paroled. In addition to enticing the witness with the possibility of parole, they also promised to make prison life easier for him in the meantime."" Scores of prisoners were indicted in connection with the uprising; only one member of the assault force was charged, with a minor offense. The state's entire case when it went to the courts was built on a scaffolding of lies designed to exonerate the assault force and punish prisoner leaders. Jurors, who saw doctored films and photographs, never knew they were being presented with fabricated and tainted evidence, including photos of crude knives that had been planted next to slain prisoners. Witnesses recited stories fed to them by government investigators. The state has never admitted wrongdoing for the Attica assault, and important parts of the record —autopsies, ballistics reports, trooper statements, and depositions— remain sealed nearly five decades later . Thompson stumbled onto Attica files in the Erie County courthouse and the New York State Museum, but since her discovery, she writes, they have vanished or ""been removed from anyone's view."" ""American voters ultimately did not respond to this prison uprising by demanding that states rein in police power, "" she concludes. ""Instead they demanded that police be given even more support and even more punitive laws to enforce. Comment: And despite the curent wave of police brutality, the sheeple continue to support them: Respect for police among Americans surges to highs not seen since late '60s ""Indeed, the 1960s and 1970s were all about the politics of the ironic. At the Democratic National Convention protests of 1968, Kent State in 1970, and Wounded Knee in 1973, unfettered police power each time turned protests violent, and yet, after each of these events, the nation was sent the message that the people, not the police, were dangerous. Somehow, voters came to believe that democracy was worth curtailing and civil rights and liberties were worth suspending for the sake of 'order' and maintaining the status quo."" Though immediately after the Attica uprising there were minor reforms, these improvements were soon rolled back. Conditions in prisons today are worse than those that led to the 1971 revolt. Control of prison populations is more brutal, more sophisticated and more inhumane. It is doubtful that the press, unlike at Attica in 1971, would ever be allowed inside a prison during an uprising to air the voices of the prisoners. Much of the worst damage was done during the Clinton administration . President Bill Clinton signed into law, with Republican support, the draconian 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. It provided $9.7 billion to build more prisons. By 1995 the prison population exceeded 1 million. It would soon double. ""The fact that so many of these people now in prison had been arrested because they were drug addicts, mentally ill, poor, and racially profiled concerned few if any politicians , whether in a statehouse or in Washington, D.C.,"" Thompson writes. ""Then, to make sure that this now enormous group of the incarcerated did not resist their deteriorating conditions of confinement via the nation's legal system as they had done so effectively both before and after the Attica uprising, in 1996 legislators passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)."" The PLRA made it difficult and often impossible for prisoners to use the courts to protect their Eighth Amendment right not to endure cruel and unusual punishment. The New York Times columnist Tom Wicker, who was part of the negotiating team that tried to resolve the Attica uprising without bloodshed, singled out white fear as the central issue in the 1971 case. ""White fear fixed itself upon the literal presence of black human beings. Black people, to whites, were the symbolic representation of the evil in man and thus were also the handy instruments by which white people could hold themselves symbolically innocent of that evil."" Wicker concluded, ""The heart of the matter was the fear of blackness."" This white fear remains unexamined in America. It allows us to stand by passively and watch the daily murders by police of unarmed black men and women. It allows us to maintain a prison system that holds a staggering 25 percent of the world's prisoners, the majority of them poor people of color. This white fear condemns us as a nation. It perpetuates the evil of white supremacy. Poor people of color have been robbed of the most elemental forms of justice and basic constitutional rights. But the state, in the age of deindustrialization, has no intention of stopping there. These forms of social control, so familiar to poor people of color, will bear upon all of us.",english,2016-10-26T22:12:46.791+03:00,sott.net,US,22891,Blueprint for social control: The brutal legacy of the Attica prison uprising,0,http://www.sott.net/image/s17/344078/full/Attica_Prison_Rebellion_leader.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

Hillary Clinton has already faced one FBI investigation for her use of a private server to transmit and store emails while she was secretary of state, and now her campaign could face a second one into the Democrats' long tradition of violent agitation. ""This is not just about inciting riots, which is bad enough, it is also about a confessed conspiracy to try to steal an election through violence."" ""There is sufficient factual predicate to open an investigation"" into the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign's involvement in the conspiracies described in the videos, Brady Toensing, a white-collar criminal defense attorney, told LifeZette. "" The potential crimes admitted to on the tapes are numerous,"" Toensing said. ""There are civil rights violations and the crime of inciting a riot. But all you need is one, and then a conspiracy to commit any of these crimes is itself a federal felony, which on its own comes with up to five years in prison,"" he added. ""There are also numerous potential state law violations and civil causes of action."" © Project Veritas Scott Foval In one of the videos, Democratic consultant and Field Director for Americans United for Change Scott Foval admitted to paying people to incite violence at Trump events. ""The bird-dogging. The aggressive bird-dogging. What I call it is 'conflict engagement,'"" Foval said. ""Conflict engagement in the lines at Trump rallies? We're starting anarchy. And he needs to understand that we're starting anarchy, "" he continued. ""We have mentally ill people that we pay to do sh**, make no mistake,"" Foval added. ""If you're there and you're protesting and you do these actions, you will be attacked at Trump rallies. That's what we want."" ""Foval is describing what is called conduct laundering, but they got sloppy,"" said Toensing, a former U.S. Senate legislative aide for campaign financing who has represented clients in multiple state and federal campaign finance investigations. ""In their arrogance, they bragged about the scheme on tape and, as part of that scheme, engaged a convicted felon, having him visit the White House more than three hundred times. It raises serious questions that call out for compelled answers given under oath,"" Toensing continued. © Project Veritas ""Wherever Trumps and Pence are going to be, we have events and we have a whole team across the country that does both consultants and people from the Democratic Party. And the Democratic Party apparatus and the people from the campaign, the Clinton campaign and my role with the campaign is to manage all that."" - Robert Creamer The felon to whom Toensing refers is Robert Creamer, a Democratic operative, DNC member, and head of the Democracy Partners organization, who spent five months in prison in 2006 on bank fraud and tax evasion charges. Creamer is the link between the campaign and Foval. ""We are contracted directly to the DNC and the campaign,"" Foval said in the video. ""I am contracted to [Creamer] but I answer to the head [of] special events for the DNC and the head of the special events and political for the campaign,"" he explained. Ultimately the campaign is responsible for his ""rapid response"" operations, Foval claimed. ""The campaign pays DNC, DNC pays Democracy Partners, Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group, the Foval Group goes and executes the sh** on the ground,"" he said. Another man caught on the video, Aaron Black, confirmed this relationship. Black identified himself as the ""deputy rapid response director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground,"" and claimed his role is secret. ""Nobody's really supposed to know about me,"" Black said. Black also said it was this conspiracy that orchestrated the violence in Chicago. ""So the Chicago protest, when they shut all that, that was us. It was more [Creamer] than me, but none of this is supposed to come back to us because we want it coming from people. We don't want it to come from the party."" Creamer himself implicated Clinton directly in this nefarious scheme. ""I mean, Hillary knows through the chain of command what's going on,"" he said. ""The campaign is fully in it."" © Project Veritas Aaron Black aka Aaron Minter This activity is a clear violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 2101, which forbids the use of ""any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, including, but not limited to, the mail, telegraph, telephone, radio, or television with intent to incite a riot; or to organize promote, encourage, or carry on a riot; or to ... aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in or carrying on a riot or committing any act of violence in furtherance of a riot."" ""The shredding machines and BleachBit were probably put to work right after the release of these tapes. So time is of the essence,"" Toensing said. ""The Republican Party should demand that state and federal authorities immediately open an investigation. They should demand that a grand jury be convened, that forthwith subpoenas be served, and that search warrants be executed,"" he suggested. There are other ways an investigation could be initiated, according to Toensing. ""Congress can do its own investigation,"" said Toensing. ""There's talk about that but they're out of session right now,"" he added. ""Someone could [also] go to a local U.S. attorney where the offence occurred,"" Toensing continued. ""If conduct spreads to a certain area, the local authorities have jurisdiction and the local district attorney can convene a jury,"" he said. ""The FBI could [also] open an investigation on its own,"" Toensing noted. He also pointed out that the Secret Service has grounds to open an investigation into ""people who are intentionally fomenting violence and creating a hazard for [a] candidate."" In either case, however, ""the U.S. attorney would then decide whether to proceed."" Unfortunately, as Toensing observed, ""the U.S. attorneys are appointed by Obama."" The way Obama's Justice Department handled the Clinton email investigation — not to mention the implications for Obama if the DNC and Clinton campaign are prosecuted for a federal conspiracy — doesn't exactly breed confidence that the administration will take action. ""I wouldn't hold my breath,"" Toensing said. Even if the Obama administration refuses to act, however, it is likely others involved will face consequences for their actions. ""This is not just about inciting riots, which is bad enough,"" said Toensing. ""It is also about a confessed conspiracy to try to steal an election through violence."" The Left has been conspiring to bring about political change through violence since its very inception. Foval himself expresses this truth perfectly in the recording. Conservatives ""have fewer guys willing to step out on the line for what they believe in,"" Foval said. ""There is a level of adherence to rules on the other side.""

As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country's government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama's presidency we've witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama's mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I'll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack's tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the ""click"" extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. ""P.J."" Crowley made his ""deal with the devil"" from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; ""Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?"" Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley's credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He's now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he's been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. ""Fuck the EU"", along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State should she reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the ""WOW"" persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don't take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the click that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November's presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed her, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as ""hash tag diplimacy."" Her ""hot mic"" comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being ""ridiculous"", they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd ""fix"" the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he's what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I'm a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby's contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department's stance on Russia's hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won't End Without Grounding Aircraft - this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington's plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the ""Kirbys"" of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby's ""Russians in body bags"" threat has pushed the Kremlin's panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline ""U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy"", it did not originate with them. Our new ""probably"" dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rotschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation's capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie The Turman Show these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since me or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation, Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message - Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause - perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It's really as simple as all that. Today's Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone's time. Once the ""Man"" has you, he's got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn't got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it's easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary's Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The ""Man"" has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people's fear they'll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell's 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn't that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts.

Speaking to a group of Goldman Sachs bankers on May 26 before the EU referendum, then-Home Secretary May said the economic arguments for remaining in the bloc were "" clear. "" In a leaked audio recording of the talk, published by the Guardian, May also claims membership in the EU makes Britain ""more safe."" ""Being part of a 500-million trading bloc is significant for us. I think, as I was saying to you a little earlier, that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the UK because it is the UK in Europe. ""If we were not in Europe, I think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say, do they need to develop a mainland Europe presence rather than a UK presence? So I think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms."" May went on to say Britain was more secure inside the EU. ""There are definitely things we can do as members of the European Union that I think keep us more safe,"" she said. A Downing Street spokesman did not comment directly on the recording, but insisted Brexit is in the UK's best interests. ""Britain made a clear choice to vote to leave the EU and this Government is determined to make a success of the fresh opportunities it presents,"" he said. ""David Davis made very clear in the House of Commons last week the importance the Government places on financial services across the UK in the negotiation to come, as has the Chancellor in recent weeks. ""We want a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union, which would be in the interests of both Britain and the EU."" Labour politicians accused May of deceiving the British public over the impact of leaving the EU's single market and called on her to be ""honest."" Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer tweeted: Andrew Gwynne, shadow minister without portfolio, said: ""As if we needed it, this recording is cast-iron evidence of how Theresa May and other senior Tories have been saying one thing in private about the economic impact of Brexit and another in the comfort of Tory conference halls. ""It's plain that she recognises what a disaster it would be for Britain to lose access to the single market, so why doesn't she be honest with the British people and say how she plans to retain it?""

It's like nothing we've seen on any other planet in the entire Universe, and now the mysterious structure on Saturn's north pole just got even weirder. In just four years, Saturn's hexagon has changed its colour from blue to gold. So far, our best guess as to why this change occurred is that this is what it looks like when Saturn's north pole gears up for next year's summer solstice. Discovered almost 30 years ago, Saturn's hexagon is a six-sided structure that spans roughly 32,000 km (20,000 miles) in diameter, and extends about 100 km (60 miles) down into the planet's dense atmosphere. As observed by NASA's Voyager and Cassini spacecraft, each point of the hexagon appears to rotate at its centre at nearly the same rate that Saturn rotates on its axis. Along the rim of the hexagon, a jet stream of air is blasting eastward at speeds of 321 km/h (200 mph). © NASA Based on its size and movements, scientists have concluded that it's a vast cloud pattern generated by a gigantic, perpetual hurricane spinning at the centre of the planet's north pole. Scientists estimate that this storm has been raging for decades - maybe even centuries . While we're pretty confident that we know what Saturn's hexagon is, the big mystery is how it got there in the first place. Once you have a giant whirlpool of air, it's relatively easy to keep it spinning - but the force you need to get it wound up in the first place is a whole lot more difficult to explain. ""Scientists have bandied about a number of explanations for the hexagon's origin,"" says Charles Q. Choi from Space.com. ""For instance, water swirling inside a bucket can generate whirlpools possessing holes with geometric shapes. However, there is of course no giant bucket on Saturn holding this gargantuan hexagon."" Now we've got something else to explain - how the Cassini spacecraft could have observed two completely different colours in the hexagon between November 2012 and September 2016. Here's more of the false colour hexagon: The best hypothesis we have right now is that this is what it looks like when Saturn changes seasons. With a year that lasts 29 Earth years, Saturn changes seasons only once every seven years, and the increased sunlight over the past three years could explain the golden haze. As NASA explains: ""The colour change is thought to be an effect of Saturn's seasons. In particular, the change from a bluish colour to a more golden hue may be due to the increased production of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere as the north pole approaches summer solstice in May 2017."" So how does this work? It's thought that the hexagon acts sort of like a barrier, preventing haze - or aerosol - particles produced on the outside from getting in. This is evidenced by the fact that when scientists analysed the hexagon in false colour (as seen in the video), they noticed differences in the types of particles that were being suspended in the atmosphere - both inside and outside the hexagon. ""Inside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,"" Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University, explained back in 2013. ""The hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth's Antarctic ozone hole."" During the polar winter between November 1995 and August 2009, Saturn's north polar atmosphere became clear of aerosols produced by photochemical reactions - reactions caused by sunlight interacting with the atmosphere - and we got to see its hexagon in clear blue: © NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute/Val Klavans True color photo taken 26 June 2013 But since Saturn reached its equinox in August 2009 - the point where the Sun is directly over Saturn's equator - it's been gradually exposed to more and more sunlight. This means for the past three years, aerosols have been produced inside of the hexagon and around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy and golden when photographed last month. Without more evidence though, this is just an educated guess , and scientists at NASA now have an investigation underway to figure out what's actually going on here. ""Other effects, including changes in atmospheric circulation, could also be playing a role,"" NASA explained this week . ""Scientists think seasonally shifting patterns of solar heating probably influence the winds in the polar regions."" Cassini is continuing its orbits around Saturn, and its moons, Titan, Mimas, Daphnis, Methone, and Pandora, in the coming months , so get ready to see more strange images of their seasonal shifts.",english,2016-10-26T22:47:02.927+03:00,sott.net,US,22891,Saturn's polar hexagon has mysteriously changed colors,0,http://www.sott.net/image/s17/353350/full/pia21049_1041_NASA.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

A Syrian hacker group claimed responsibility, saying the attack was retaliation for the Belgian air force bombing a village near Aleppo. A number of Belgian media websites, including De Standaard, RTBF, Het Nieuwsblad, Gazet van Antwerpen and Het Belang van Limburg, reported they have been subjected to a coordinated DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack on Monday afternoon, which temporarily shut down their sites. The attack was claimed by a group calling itself the Syrian Cyber Army, as punishment for the media helping to cover up their government's actions in Aleppo . ""We attacked the Belgian media that hide the work of its air force in Syria,"" a statement on their website reads . ""We call on the international community to support us in shaming the Belgian authorities, who orders the killing of dozens of civilians in the town of Hassadjek near Aleppo on October 18, and caused damage to civilian infrastructure,"" the Syrian hackers wrote. ""Instead of strikes on Daesh [Islamic State], the international coalition led by the United States targets only civilians and deceives the international community about its goals in Syria."" The attack comes in the wake of information from the Russian Defense Ministry that two Belgian F-16 jets flying from Jordan struck Hassadjek in Aleppo province on October 18, killing six civilians. The Belgian government has strongly denied involvement in the bombing, and has demanded that Russia take back the accusations. The Het Nieuwsblad has alleged that Russia supports and finances the hacking group. The hacking attack itself appears to have been carried out from Turkey. However, the federal prosecutor's office has yet to start an investigation. Over the course of the civil war, Syrian hacking groups have claimed attacks on various news organizations they believe paint the Assad government in a negative light. Among these is the Syrian Electronic Army, formed in 2011, which has targeted the BBC, al-Jazeera and National Public Radio, among other outlets. Their tactics range from DDoS attacks - in which thousands of computers will overwhelm a server by requesting access all at once - to spamming, malware, phishing and defacing websites. Some of the attacks have been humorous at times. After hacking the BBC Weather's Twitter, a headline read ""Saudi weather station down due to head on-collision with camel.""

According to new genetic modelling, the species is unlikely to be Neanderthal or Denisovan - two ancient species that are represented in the fossil record - but could represent a third, unknown human relative that has so far eluded archaeologists. ""We're missing a population, or we're misunderstanding something about the relationships,"" Ryan Bohlender, a statistical geneticist from the University of Texas, told Tina Hesman Saey at Science News. Bohlender and his team have been investigating the percentages of extinct hominid DNA that modern humans still carry today, and say they've found discrepancies in previous analyses that suggest our mingling with Neanderthals and Denisovans isn't the whole story. It's thought that between 100,000 and 60,000 years ago, our early ancestors migrated out of Africa, and first made contact with other hominid species living on the Eurasian landmass. This contact left a mark on our species that can still be found today, with Europeans and Asians carrying distinct genetic variants of Neanderthal DNA in their own genomes. And that's not all they've given us. Earlier this year, researchers investigated certain genetic variants that people of European descent inherited from Neanderthals , and found that they're associated with several health problems, including a slightly increased risk of depression, heart attack, and a number of skin disorders. And a separate study published earlier this month found evidence that modern genital warts - otherwise known as the human papillomavirus (HPV) - were sexually transmitted to Homo sapiens after our ancestors slept with Neanderthals and Denisovans once they left Africa. While our relationship with Neanderthals has been widely researched, how we interacted with the Denisovans - the distant cousins of Neanderthals - is less clear. The problem is that Neanderthals are well represented in the fossil record, with many remains having been uncovered across Europe and Asia, but all we have of the Denisovans is a lone finger bone and a couple of teeth that were found in a Siberian cave in 2008 . Using a new computer model to figure out the amount of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA carried by modern humans, Bohlender and his colleague found that Europeans and Chinese people carry a similar amount of Neanderthal DNA: about 2.8 percent. That result is pretty similar to previous studies have estimated that Europeans and Asians carry, on average, between 1.5 and 4 percent Neanderthal DNA. But when they got to Denisovan DNA, things were a bit more complicated, particularly when it came to modern populations living in Melanesia - a region of the South Pacific that includes Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, West Papua, and the Maluku Islands. As Hesman Saey explains for Science News: ""Europeans have no hint of Denisovan ancestry, and people in China have a tiny amount - 0.1 percent, according to Bohlender's calculations. But 2.74 percent of the DNA in people in Papua New Guinea comes from Neanderthals. And Bohlender estimates the amount of Denisovan DNA in Melanesians is about 1.11 percent, not the 3 to 6 percent estimated by other researchers. While investigating the Denisovan discrepancy, Bohlender and colleagues came to the conclusion that a third group of hominids may have bred with the ancestors of Melanesians."" ""Human history is a lot more complicated than we thought it was,"" he told her. This find is supported by a separate study by researchers from the Natural History Museum of Denmark, who analysed DNA from 83 Aboriginal Australians and 25 locals from the Papua New Guinea highlands. As we reported last month, this was the most comprehensive genetic study of Indigenous Australians to date, and it indicated that they are the oldest continuous civilisation on Earth, dating back more than 50,000 years ago. But the results revealed something else - DNA that was very similar to that of the Denisovans, but distinct enough for the researchers to suggest that it could have come from a third, unidentified hominid . ""Who this group is we don't know,"" lead researcher Eske Willerslev told Hesman Saey. Until we have more concrete evidence of this hypothesised third human species (some fossils would be nice), we can't prove this , and we should point out that Bohlender's estimates have yet to be formally peer-reviewed , so they might shift with further scrutiny. And it could be that our identification of Denisovan DNA is more ambiguous than we think, given that our only source is a finger bone and a couple of teeth. But the evidence is mounting that our interactions with ancient humans were far more complex than we'd assumed, which shouldn't be much of a surprise, when you think about it. Just because we don't see them in the fossil record doesn't mean they didn't exist - preserving the remains of something for tens of thousands of years isn't easy, and then someone has to be in the right place at the right time to dig them up. Hopefully, the more we investigate the genetic make-up of our most ancient societies, the more hints we'll get of the rich and complicated history our species shared with those that didn't make it to modern times.

Yesterday the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church urged followers not to scatter the ashes of the dead after cremation and instead to store them in places approved by the Church. ""We'll make all the decisions on who and what goes where, thank you very much,"" German cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller, the prefect of the doctrinal watchdog, told WWN, ""Scattering the remains of loved ones on unholy ground will only ruin their chances of staying in heaven. But the scattering of paedophile priests is fine, though; when we're doing it,"" before adding, ""Please leave all the important decisions on the welfare of others to us. We won't let any of our worshipers down"". The latest move comes just 53 years after the Vatican 'legalised' cremation, mirroring the amount of time it takes for the church to act on various different subjects, including child sex abuse. ""We don't make decisions lightly here, so we like to take our time,"" the Cardinal admitted, ""But when we do, we like to make sure that they are the best decisions tailored for the financial gain of our multi-billion euro a year organisation"". A two-page instruction issuing new rules on cremation also said that there were even some cases where a Christian funeral could be denied to those who request that ashes be scattered. ""There is absolutely no profit for us if someone gets cremated and spread over some field for free,"" Muller pointed out, breathing on a 24 carrot ring on his hand before polishing it on his silk gown, ""We offer an array of allotments across the world, and at a bargain price too. We'll even throw in an annual mass and a few prayers graveside for any cremated relative wishing to be buried on sacred ground"".

Although all signs point to foul play, indeed murder, by Turkish intelligence, until now the US government has neither conducted nor demanded an inquiry into the events of the alleged car accident which Turkish officials say was the cause of Shim's death, let alone offer condolences to the family. Serena Shim was at the time reporting on Ayn al-Arab (Kobani), from the Turkish side. She was, in her own words, one of the first, if not the first, on the ground to report on ,""Takfiri militants going in through the Turkish border"". These include not only ISIS but also terrorists from the so-called Free Syrian Army (FSA). As Shim's sister Fatmeh Shim stated in 2015 , ""She caught them bringing in ISIS high-ranked members into Syria from Turkey into camps, which are supposed to be Syrian refugee camps."" Serena Shim's January 2013 expose , Turkey's Pivotal Role in Syria's Insurgency: PressTV Report from Inside Turkey, showed footage of what she estimated to be 300 semi-trucks ""awaiting militants to empty them out""; included testimony explaining how Turkey enables the crossing of foreign terrorists ""freely"" into Syria; spoke of the funneling of arms via the Incirlik US Air Base in Turkey to terrorists in refugee camps or on through to Syria; and highlighted the issue of terrorist training camps portrayed as refugee camps, guarded by the Turkish military. Shim named the World Food Organization as one of the NGOs whose trucks were being used to funnel terrorists' arms into Syria, and stated this in her last interview, just one day before being killed. Notably, in that interview she also explicitly stated that she feared for her life because Turkish intelligence had accused her of being a spy. She told Press TV: ""Turkey has been labeled by Reporters Without Borders as the largest prison for journalists, so I am a bit frightened about what they might use against me... I'm hoping that nothing is going to happen, that it's going to blow over. I would assume that they are going to take me in for questioning, and the next hope is that my lawyer is good enough to get me out as soon as possible."" Two days later, Press TV announced her death , stating: ""Serena was killed in a reported car accident when she was returning from a report scene in the city of Suruch in Turkey's Urfa province. She was going back to her hotel in Urfa when their car collided with a heavy vehicle."" This was the official version of her death, although in subsequent versions the story changed. In a report one month later, Russia Today (RT) spoke with Shim's sister, who said: ""There's so many different stories. The first was that Serena's car was hit by a heavy vehicle, who proceeded to keep on driving. They could not find the vehicle nor could they find the driver. Two days later, surprisingly, they had found the vehicle and the driver, and had pictures of the heavy vehicle hitting my sister's car. Every day coming out with new pictures of different degrees of damages that have happened to the car."" ""Serena and my cousin who was the driver of the car were taken to two different hospitals. She was reported first dead at the scene. Then coming out with later reports that she passed away at the hospital 30 minutes later from heart failure?! "" POLITICAL BLACKOUT, MEDIA BLACKOUT When on November 20, 2014, at a Daily Press Briefing, RT journalist Gayane Chichakyan twice pressed Director of Press Office, Jeff Rathke, for updates on Shim's death, he unsurprisingly gave none: Chichakyan: ""It's about the journalist Serena Shim, who died in Turkey under very suspicious circumstances. Did her death raise suspicions here at the State Department?"" Rathke: ""Well, I think we've spoken to this in the briefing room several weeks ago, after it happened. I don't have anything to add to what the spokesperson said at the time, though."" Chichakyan: ""But then she died several days after she claimed she had been threatened by the Turkish intelligence. Have you inquired about this? Have you asked questions? Is there really nothing new about this?"" Rathke: ""Well, I just don't have any update to share with you. Again, this was raised shortly after her death. The spokesperson addressed it. I don't have an update to share with you at this time."" Chichakyan: ""I just want to go back to Serena Shim. You rightly said the State Department commented on her death several weeks ago, and you say there is no update. Why is there no update? A U.S. citizen dies days after she said she'd been threatened by the Turkish intelligence."" Rathke: ""Well, I simply don't have any information to share at this time. I'm happy to check and see if there's anything additional. We spoke out about it, as I said, at the very start several weeks ago after her death, so I - but I don't have anything with me right now to offer. I'm happy to check and see if there's more that we can share."" Of course, neither he nor any US government official has followed up . Last year, Shim's mother, Judy Poe, replied to me in a message: ""There is no doubt in my mind that my daughter did not die in a car accident. There was not one single scratch on her there was no blood absolutely anywhere. I have tried to contact the American Embassy in Turkey with the cell phone numbers they gave me originally when I was going to get my daughter. Absolutely no response from the American Embassy in Turkey, including via personal cell phones."" Shim's sister in her RT interview stated, ""We've got no support whatsoever, nor have we got condolences."" None of the major journalist organizations have pursued a just investigation into Shim's murder, much less lamented it. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) turns up zero results when Shim's name is searched on their website . Yet, the CPJ does have a list of journalists killed in Turkey since 1992, and as recent as Feb 2016, obviously minus Shim's name. Likewise, a search on the Reporters Without Borders website turns up zero results . A December 19, 2014 article at the Greanville Post does have a CPJ spokesperson stating: ""The Committee to Protect Journalists has investigated the events surrounding Serena Shim's death in Turkey and at this time has found no evidence to indicate that her death was anything other than a tragic accident. Unless her death is confirmed to be in direct relation to her work as a journalist, it will not appear on our database. In the event that new evidence comes to light, CPJ would review her case."" The article Greanville Post notes, ""As of February 2016, the CPJ has not changed its position."" The International Federation of Journalists does have a short entry on Shim: ""Serena Shim, the female correspondent for Press TV in Turkey was killed in a car accident on the Turkish-Syrian border. She was returning from an assignment in Suruç, a rural district of Şanlıurfa Province of Turkey when her car collided with a truck."" But no call for inquiry and no questioning of official narrative. In a November 21, 2014 article at Shim's death, RT noted that, ""the office of the Representative on Freedom of the Media at the OSCE told RT that Turkey is carrying out an investigation."" It cited OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, Gunnar Vrang, as saying: ""The representative has been following the case since the first reports appeared about the car accident that claimed the life of journalist Serena Shim. According to information available to her office, the Turkish authorities have started investigation into the details of the car accident."" Searching the OSCE for Serena Shim's name also results in zero hits. On February 5, 2016, Judy Poe tweeted: Clearly the representative went with the Turkish rendition of events. Few in corporate media have looked into Shim's suspicious death. In one surprising exception, Fox News reported on Shim's death, citing a US State Department spokesperson as saying the State Department ""does not conduct investigations into deaths overseas."" Given that Turkish intelligence threatened Shim, according to her testimony, and that Turkey is notorious world-wide for its imprisonment and murder of journalists, the US State Department's lack of concern is incriminating in itself. In stark contrast to the silence around Shim's death, John Kerry at least twice publicly mourned the death of James Foley, lauding as a hero the journalist who snuck into Syria via Turkey to report embedded with al-Qaeda and other terrorists, and giving sincere condolences to his family. Without a trace of irony, in August 2014, Kerry said of Foley , and never of Shim, ""We honor the courage and pray for the safety of all those who risk their lives to discover the truth where it is needed most."" In September, 2014, Kerry directly contradicted the above-mentioned words of the State Department spokesperson, saying: ""When terrorists anywhere around the world have murdered our citizens, the United States held them accountable, no matter how long it took. And those who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no matter how long it takes."" On the media and political blackout around Serena Shim's suspicious death, Shim's former colleague, Afshin Rattansi, host of RT's Going Underground posited: ""There were a few press reports, but nothing like the kind of reporting about a brave young journalist that one would expect. Was this because the story she was covering was so dangerous that a NATO ally like Turkey should be cooperating with ISIS... was that the reason that this story has not been more widely broadcast? We don't know."" Indeed, this would not be the first time the US administration has not pursued justice for the murder of one of its citizens by an ally. Rachie Corrie's March 16, 2013 murder by an Israeli soldier driving a bulldozer was not only witnessed by numerous rights activists with Corrie in Rafah, occupied Palestine, but was filmed. There is no denial that the Israeli soldier saw Corrie, drove his dozer over her and then reversed back, crushing her twice. Yet, in spite of the efforts of her family and supporters, the US has never pursued justice for this American citizen either. Judy Poe said that Serena's favourite motto was: ""I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees."" Shim lived the motto. She was 29, with two children, when killed. Eva Bartlett is an independent writer and rights activist with extensive experience in Syria and in the Gaza Strip, where she lived a cumulative three years (from late 2008 to early 2013). She documented the 2008/9 and 2012 Israeli war crimes and attacks on Gaza while riding in ambulances and reporting from hospitals. From June-August 2016, she visited Syria for her fifth time. Her writings can be found on her blog, In Gaza (www.ingaza.wordpress.com) Comment: It seems evident Shim was too close to revealing the true situation and the players involved.

By so doing, you will bequeath to your successor —whomever it might be— a solid foundation on which to build a healthier and more peaceful Planet Earth. The United States should re-commit to the policy of non-interference in domestic affairs abroad that our Founding Fathers consistently proclaimed and adhered to. Instead of imposing our cherished values of ""free-market"" and ""democracy"" abroad, let us rely on the wisdom of a man who risked the reputation of a ""traitor"" when he defied King George's war on American colonies. I am talking about Edmund Burke, the British philosopher and father of modern conservatism. Like ancient Greeks he argued that each country is entitled to its own form of government, be it democracy, republic, monarchy, tyranny or despotism, each of which tend to evolve into its opposite. Therefore, the colonies do not have to bow to the King. Burke's monument now graces Washington DC. In respect to Russia, remember that Empress Catherine the Great refused King George's request to send Russian Cossacks help him quell George Washington's rebellion. During the Civil War, while Europe's powers-- Great Britain, France, and Spain—tried to take advantage of President Lincoln's problems with the South, Tsar Alexander II who had just abolished serfdom in Russia, sent Russian Navy to the harbors of New York and San Francisco as a gesture of Good Will. More recently, in spite of the USSR's unconcealed hostility to ""Capitalist"" America, the two countries were able to co-operate in the defeat of Nazi Germany and Japan, and then keep the bitterness of Cold War in check. After 1991, the Communist Russia is no more. The New Russia has been espousing the same values of private property, free enterprise, multi-party free elections, secular government, and freedom of speech and religion— as we do. To be sure, the post-1991 Russian road has been rocky, but this because we meddled on the side of the Russian oligarchs and because it takes years and decades to cultivate free enterprise and democracy in a country that had none for 73 years. In late 1980s, when I was writing Russia Beyond Communism: A Chronicle of National Rebirth (Westview Press, 1991), Soviet soldiers were forbidden to wear crucifix. Now General Sergei Shoigu, Russia's Minister of Defense, would not enter the Red Square without crossing himself publicly. President Vladimir Putin is regularly seen in a church in front of an icon and has addressed Russian Muslims in a mosque and Jews in a synagogue. It's a truly tectonic shift in global affairs since the end of the Cold War in 1991. Therefore, I say, Mr. President, take a breath of fresh air and do what it takes to make your Nobel Peace Prize count: Leave the legacy of peace-seeking negotiations with Russia from which your successor will not deviate lest he or she be called an abominable war monger. More than any other two countries, Russia and the United States are called upon safeguard Peace, Freedom and Commerce not just from San Francisco to Vladivostok, but on the entire Planet Earth.

Militant groups once again targeted West Aleppo's Hamdaniya district, as they continued to shell residential areas controlled by the government forces. Tuesday's attack came just a day after three people were killed, including a child, and 28 more injured in another attack on Hamdaniya and Salahuddin neighborhoods. The latest shelling occurred about 10am local time (07:00 GMT), reported Murad Gazdiev, RT's correspondent at the scene.

Militants and terrorists that took up positions in eastern Aleppo have been constantly and indiscriminately shelling the western part of the city. On October 18, at least three people were killed and dozens injured when the Jamiliya neighborhood was shelled. The attacks come as Russia and Syrian government forces initiated a humanitarian pause by halting their air strikes a week ago. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, the city did not witness any Russian or Syria air strikes for a week. Officers from the Russian reconciliation center and Syrian authorities also helped 48 women and children to leave the rebel-held area on Monday and provided them with necessary aid. Meanwhile, militants repeatedly sabotaged the ceasefire efforts by shelling humanitarian corridors and killing civilians.

As the authors of the study, Elizabeth Lee Reisinger Walker and Benjamin G. Druss, observe: ""The health of individuals in the U.S.A. is increasingly being defined by complexity and multimorbidity , the co-occurrence of two or more chronic medical conditions."" Given the medical and socio-economic difficulties often faced by people with mental illness, and the lack of research into the other medical conditions they might suffer from, the authors set out to discover, using publicly available data, what proportion of US adults experience each combination of mental illness, substance abuse/dependence and chronic mental conditions. They also investigated how those combinations of conditions were related to poverty. They found that overall, 18.4% of adults had a mental illness in the past year, and 8.6% reported substance abuse/dependence during the same time. Nearly 40% had one or more chronic medical conditions in their lifetimes, and 14.7% were living in poverty. Compared to individuals without any condition, adults with one condition (any mental illness [AMI], substance abuse/dependence or chronic conditions) reported higher percentages of living in poverty, receiving government assistance, having less than a high-school education, being unemployed, and having no health insurance. When looked at together, 6.4% of individuals reported AMI and chronic conditions, 2.2% reported AMI and substance abuse/dependence, 1.5% reported substance abuse/dependence and chronic medical conditions, and 1.2% -- equivalent to 2.2 million people -- reported all three conditions. The association between mental illness and substance abuse is also laid bare by the study: people with AMI were over three times more likely to report substance abuse/dependence, almost 1.5 times more likely to have a chronic medical condition, and 1.2 times more likely to live in poverty. As Elizabeth Lee Reisinger Walker commented on the research last week: ""Just over half of adults in the US have one or more chronic condition, mental disorder, or dependence on substances. These conditions commonly overlap with each other and with poverty, which contributes to poor health."" The pair conclude that improving the health of people with multimorbidities will involve increased access to and coordination between a variety of services. As they observe: ""Collaborative care models are effective in treating mental illnesses in primary care and providing primary care in specialty mental health settings."" Walker concludes: ""In order to promote overall health, it is important to consider all of a person's health conditions along with poverty and other social factors."" But what the future holds for the 50% of Americans suffering from multiple health challenges remains to be seen. Journal Reference: Elizabeth Reisinger Walker, Benjamin G. Druss.

But despite this, the government has promised to reimburse our super-rich Queen £1m for the money she'll lose out on when leaving the EU. The leaked documents A series of leaked documents , posted on the government's website in error , has revealed that the Treasury faces a black hole of up to £16bn this year. Due to a combination of poor economic decisions and increased levels of borrowing, this means that the UK's deficit is well behind the 27% forecasted reduction rate. With the uncertainty of the global financial market, this black hole is only likely to increase. As The Canary previously reported , many global banks are again stockpiling gold. This is to secure their assets and ensure their currency can be backed up in case of an emergency. During Gordon Brown's reign, however, the UK sold off the majority of its gold, meaning the UK's currency isn't supported by any assets. If a global financial crash were to come, this would prove devastating. The Queen Despite these dire circumstances, the government has promised to secure the Queen's wealth and reimburse her for any losses which may occur after Brexit. The Queen, like many other aristocrats, benefits from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy . Initially created in 1962 to help protect farmers against unstable crop prices, it has instead been helping the most wealthy and privileged. Every year, the UK's richest landowners receive payouts, with the Queen bagging over £1m a year . Sandringham Estate receives close to £700,000 a year, while Windsor Castle receives £300,000. Prince Charles also benefits from the EU's policy and gets £100,000 a year just for his estates. Since the announcement of the Brexit vote, the Conservative government has pledged [ paywall ] to pick up the subsidy bill at least until 2020. Sir Gerald Howarth, a former Conservative defence minister who backed Brexit, said : What we all said during the Leave campaign was that all those currently in receipt of so-called EU money will continue to receive the same money because we will be saving £20bn every year. We must reassure the recipients - whether it's Her Majesty or farmers - that they will continue to benefit from the current arrangements. The Queen and the Treasury While money made from the Crown's estates feeds back into the Treasury, the Queen and her family still benefit from a large profit. These estates, known as the ""Sovereign's public estate"", are technically neither government property nor part of the monarch's private estate. But the government still pays the Queen. On top of the Brexit reimbursement, the monarch is set to receive £42.8m from the Treasury between 2016-2017. This figure is £12m more than that in 2012 and means an extra £2.7m will be taken from the taxpayers' pocket. So while the Treasury faces a black hole six times the size of the NHS deficit , the government is continuing to spend the taxpayers' money to provide for a super-wealthy aristocrat. While many people may still support the Queen, it cannot be denied that the monarchy is losing its appeal. In a recent review , it was discovered that Chester Zoo, Stonehenge, and the Roman Baths are more successful tourist attractions than Windsor Castle. Alongside this, more and more republicans are calling for a referendum on abolishing the monarchy after the Queen dies. If the government continues to prioritise her over the needs of the British public, support for this cause may well increase.",english,2016-10-26T23:08:31.560+03:00,sott.net,US,22891,The Queen gets £1m reimbursement for Brexit despite the Treasury having a £16bn financial black hole,0,http://www.sott.net/image/s17/353463/full/queen_770x470.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

Gen. Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik that the move signals major changes in Turkish foreign policy. Russia has already started sharing its intelligence data with the Turkish army, which will ensure the effectiveness of Ankara's Euphrates Shield operation in Syria, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported on Monday. According to the newspaper, the agreement was reached during recent negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security at the Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Franz Klintsevich told the newspaper that Turkey quietly joined the intelligence sharing pool created by Russia, Syria, Iraq and Iran . ""We pass Turkey data on our radio intercepts, electronic intelligence and imagery intelligence that may be of interest to it,"" the senator said. ""In response, they also share information. Turkey has very effective intelligence agencies and very good agents in Syria ,"" he added. Commenting on the move, Retired Air Lieutenant General Erdogan Karakus, General President of TESUD (Turkey Retired Officers Association) told Sputnik Turkiye that the pace of development of Russian-Turkish relations amid the mounting tension in Turkish-American relations signifies major changes to Turkish foreign policy. Ankara is demonstrating its readiness to upgrade its cooperation with Moscow to an unprecedented level , creating prerequisites for further strategic partnerships, including in the military-political sphere. ""Turkey pays high importance to the Open Skies Treaty. Signed in 1992, it is aimed mainly at strengthening trust between the signatories,"" Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik. ""Unfortunately this February Turkey denied Russia an observation flight over its territory. However the situation has drastically changed since then and Russian inspectors now perform observation flights over Turkey . This is one of the major indications of a new stage in development of Russian-Turkish relations,"" he added. ""The exchange of intelligence data, negotiations on the creation of a Turkish anti-missile defense system with the deployment of Russia's S-300 and S-400 systems, the opening of its territory for observation flights signifies the growing trust in relations between the two countries,"" Karakus said. Retired Air Lieutenant General noted that such a development is only more natural as the American 'Greater Middle East' project equally worries both Russia and Turkey. To be able to prevent all the threats arising from this project the cooperation between the two countries should be ultimately upgraded to a strategic level. There are no hurdles for the further strategic partnership between the two, Karakus finally stated. Comment: This should pretty much put to rest any speculation that Ankara at risk of coming to the aid of the terrorists in eastern Aleppo. Russia would not develop such close ties with them if there was a risk Turkey would basically go to war against the Syrian army, and thus the Russians as well. In all likelihood, Erdogan is acting within certain clearly defined limits in northern Syria.",english,2016-10-26T23:10:56.625+03:00,sott.net,US,22891,Russia and Turkey Now Sharing Intelligence Data,0,http://www.sott.net/image/s17/353466/full/1044714330.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

Our galaxy, the Milky Way, appears as a luminous band across the sky with the Galactic Center in the middle. The Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are prominently visible in orange below the Galactic plane. They are surrounded by huge clouds of gas, forcefully disrupted from their hosts by gravitational interaction with the Milky Way. The HI emissions of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) and its neighbor, Triangulum (M33), are also easy to spot as bright purple ellipses in the lower left. The gas motion is color-coded to represent the gas's motion, and the visual brightness in the image relates to how much neutral hydrogen is present. Hydrogen is the single most abundant element in the universe. The simple pairing of a proton and electron is so reactive that atomic hydrogen doesn't occur naturally on Earth — it reacts with itself or other elements to form molecules instead. But in the large, mostly empty space between stars floats a copious amount of neutral atomic hydrogen. We only know it's there when the atom's lone electron very occasionally flips from an ""up"" state to a ""down"" state, releasing a single 21-centimeter radio wave. Modern radio telescopes can easily pick up the faint signal, which multiplies thanks to the wealth of hydrogen atoms. What's hard is to map that signal across the entire sky — and that's exactly what astronomers have done in unprecedented detail. Using two of the world's largest fully steerable radio dishes, the 100-meter Effelsberg dish near Bonn, Germany, and the 64-meter Parkes dish west of Sydney, Australia, astronomers have generated a survey they've dubbed HI4PI. Pronounced ""hi four pie,"" the survey refers to the abbreviation for neutral hydrogen (HI) and the geometrical reference to the whole sky (4PI, or 4&pi;). Over thousands of hours on the sky, the dishes took more than a million individual observations. Thousands more hours went into processing dozens of terabytes of data, removing radio interference from broadcast stations, military radar, and other Earthbound sources, then stitching everything together into a seamless map of the hydrogen sky. The resulting image is incredible: the ultrafine detail reveals fine threads and diffuse clouds in the interstellar medium never seen before. And for astronomers studying faraway X-ray or gamma-ray sources, the map will prove essential in cleaning the window to the distant universe. The map shows not only the amount of hydrogen at each celestial location, but also the motion of hydrogen across the sky: the 21-centimeter radio signal shifts to slightly lower or higher energies as the hydrogen gas moves toward or away from us, respectively. Watch the video below to take a stepwise look through the data, seeing first the most negative velocities (infalling gas, moving toward Earth) and ending with the most positive radial velocities (receding gas from Earth's perspective).",english,2016-10-26T23:25:25.853+03:00,sott.net,US,22891,Milky Way galaxy mapped in incredible detail,0,http://www.sott.net/image/s17/353467/full/milky_way.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country's government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama's presidency we've witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama's mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I'll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack's tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the ""clique"" extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. ""P.J."" Crowley made his ""deal with the devil"" from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared Pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; ""Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?"" Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley's credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He's now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he's been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. ""Fuck the EU"", along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State should she reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the ""WOW"" persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don't take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the clique that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November's presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as ""hash tag diplomacy."" Her ""hot mic"" comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being ""ridiculous"", they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd ""fix"" the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he's what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I'm a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby's contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department's stance on Russia's hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won't End Without Grounding Aircraft - this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington's plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the ""Kirbys"" of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby's ""Russians in body bags"" threat has pushed the Kremlin's panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline ""U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy"", it did not originate with them. Our new ""probably"" dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rothschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation's capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie The Truman Show these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since I or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation , Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message - Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause - perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It's really as simple as all that. Today's Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone's time. Once the ""Man"" has you, he's got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn't got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it's easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary's Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, naïve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The ""Man"" has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people's fear they'll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell's 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn't that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze, liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts.

The North-Western Front. Kiev is trying to re-write history to create the impression that Ukraine was uniformly a victim of a Russian-controlled USSR. This is simply not true. The old shared state wasn't always dominated by Russians and Ukrainians played major roles. In case you missed it, last week, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's Parliament, approved a document which states how the USSR was responsible for the outbreak of World War II. Yes, that Soviet Union, the same one which was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, and lost anywhere between 25 and 40 million people as a result of the conflict, depending on who you believe. That the Rada these days exhibits more theatricality than its famous London drama school namesake is a given. But do MPs seriously expect people to swallow the notion of how the USSR, which incidentally was allied with Britain, France and the USA against the Germans, bears responsibility for the war's commencement? It seems they do. And they are trying to rope in the Polish and Lithuanians to legitimize their factual modification enterprise. Indeed, given the characters running the show in Vilnius and Warsaw these days, it's not inconceivable that they might succeed in their mission. Although in the latter's case it would be weird to facilitate the heirs of a mindset shared by the perpetrators of the Volyn and Galician massacre where up to 100,000 Poles were butchered by Ukrainian radicals in 1943. Incidentally, Ukraine has just censored a new Polish movie about the carnage. It's no secret how Kiev is crawling with foreign PR advisers these days, and much of the country's rebranding efforts since Maidan have displayed a level of sophistication heretofore unseen in the ex-Communist world. But this latest wheeze is incredible in its deviousness. The justification for the archival editing is the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, which divided Poland between Germany and the USSR. Now, that treaty was immoral and make no mistake about it. But it came after France and Britain had destroyed any chance for an anti-fascist front with the Munich Agreement, which allowed Hitler to march into Czechoslovakia. And many scholars contend that Moscow signed it in order to buy time before the inevitable Hitler invasion. It's worth mentioning how Ukrainians played a big part in the governance of the Soviet Union back then. And highlighting the fact that Poland itself also seized a part of Czechoslovakia in 1938 when it annexed the Teschen District! Which somewhat undermines its victimhood. False Correlation Despite Kiev's current attempts to paint the Soviet Union as a Russian-only affair, the historical reality is rather different. For instance, the original ""People's Commissars"" (equivalent to a ministerial cabinet) who created the state were a multi-national mix, featuring a Georgian by the name of Josef Stalin and three Ukrainians. Leon Trotsky, who essentially 'co-founded' the USSR with Vladimir Lenin, hailed from Kherson and Anatoly Lunacharsky was a native of Poltava. Meanwhile, Pavel Dybenko was born in Russia's border city of Bryansk to a Ukrainian family. Later, after Stalin replaced Lenin, the Georgian's Grigory Ordzhonikidze and Lavrentiy Beria came into the Kremlin's elite circle, in addition to Armenia's Anastas Mikoyan. And during the war, two men with deep associations to Ukraine began to rise up the ranks. The first was Nikita Khrushchev, who moved to Donbass as a teenager and subsequently began his working life and political career in the country. He went on to transfer Russia's Crimea province to Kiev in 1954. In fairness, Khrushchev was ethnically Russian but the man who followed him was a genuine Ukrainian. That was Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party from 1964 to 1982. He was born in Kamenskoye, near Dnipropetrovsk. Furthermore, on his own 1947 passport his nationality is listed as Ukrainian. In fact, you could argue that Brezhnev, a man of exquisite tastes, was the Viktor Yanukovich of his day. Let's not forget the KGB either , regarded as the greatest symbol of Russian repression by Ukraine's nationalists. The problem with this yarn is is three of its eight chairmen were born in the country. The head Chekist in the 1961-1967 period was Vladimir Semichastny, from Donbas. While he has was Russian by blood, in 1982, the fully Ukrainian Vitaly Fedorchuk, a native of Zhitomir, took over. He didn't last long, but his successor, who bossed the KGB from 1982 to 1988, was Dnipropetrovsk's Viktor Chebrikov. The Real Agenda The point is that this highly organized PR campaign is trying to create a counter-factual historical narrative. In the new reality, Ukraine is attempting to make itself seem like a victim of 'Soviet Russia' when in fact most of the country was an integral part of the USSR, and very willingly so. Sure, west Ukrainians - mostly centered around Lviv - hated being connected to Moscow, but they have always been a minority inside their own country. Thus, for Ukraine to try team up with Poland and Lithuania now is quite comical. These two countries were invaded by both of the eastern front's main belligerents and suffered greatly. By contrast, what Ukraine endured was overwhelmingly imposed from Berlin. And the fact that over seven million Ukrainians fought in the Red Army is proof positive of where Kiev's loyalties lay in World War II. The problem today is that the post-Maidan regime is in desperate need of new chronicles to underpin its historic shift away from Moscow. Even if they are totally fictional. We also see this in attempts to lionize Stepan Bandera, who much of the country perceives as a Nazi collaborator and whose henchmen carried out the aforementioned Volyn and Galician massacres. The western PR advisers concocting this rubbish might feel they are being clever right now, but in the long term they are dividing Ukrainians once again into eastern and western camps. And when the next inevitable power shift tilts control back in the other direction, the chronology and commemorations will change again. The fact is that Kiev should be seeking a ""national idea"" which unifies the country. But every time the rulers change, the side in power seeks to impose its interpretation of the past. So long as this continues, Ukraine will never be united and stable. And that's very sad.

A new study, published in the journal Redox Biology , also highlighted a compound -- N-acetyl-cysteine, or NAC -- that is already used in high doses in medical detoxification emergencies. But the researchers said that at much lower levels NAC might help maintain glutathione levels and prevent the routine metabolic declines associated with aging. In that context, the research not only offers some profound insights into why the health of animals declines with age, but specifically points to a compound that might help prevent some of the toxic processes involved. Decline of these detoxification pathways , scientists say, are causally linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer , some of the primary causes of death in the developed world. ""We've known for some time of the importance of glutathione as a strong antioxidant,"" said Tory Hagen, lead author on the research and the Helen P. Rumbel Professor for Health Aging Research in the Linus Pauling Institute at OSU. ""What this study pointed out was the way that cells from younger animals are far more resistant to stress than those from older animals,"" said Hagen, also a professor of biochemistry in the OSU College of Science. ""In young animal cells, stress doesn't cause such a rapid loss of glutathione. The cells from older animals, on the other hand, were quickly depleted of glutathione and died twice as fast when subjected to stress. ""But pretreatment with NAC increased glutathione levels in the older cells and largely helped offset that level of cell death."" Glutathione, Hagen said, is such an important antioxidant that its existence appears to date back as far as oxygen-dependent, or aerobic life itself -- about 1.5 billion years. It's a principal compound to detoxify environmental stresses, air pollutants, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals and many other toxic insults. In this study, scientists tried to identify the resistance to toxins of young cells, compared to those of older cells. They used a toxic compound called menadione to stress the cells, and in the face of that stress the younger cells lost significantly less of their glutathione than older cells did. The glutathione levels of young rat cells never decreased to less than 35 percent of its initial level, whereas in older rat cells glutathione levels plummeted to 10 percent of their original level. NAC, the researchers said, is known to boost the metabolic function of glutathione and increase its rate of synthesis. It's already used in emergency medicine to help patients in a toxic crisis, such as ingestion of poisonous levels of heavy metals. It's believed to be a very safe compound to use even at extremely high levels -- and the scientists are hypothesizing that it might have significant value at much lower doses to maintain glutathione levels and improve health. ""I'm optimistic there could be a role for this compound in preventing the increased toxicity we face with aging, as our abilities to deal with toxins decline,"" Hagen said. ""We might be able to improve the metabolic resilience that we're naturally losing with age."" Also of interest, Hagen said, is the wide range of apparent detoxification potential offered by glutathione. Higher levels of it -- boosted by NAC -- might help reduce the toxicity of some prescription drugs, cancer chemotherapies , and treat other health issues. ""Using NAC as a prophylactic, instead of an intervention, may allow glutathione levels to be maintained for detoxification in older adults,"" the researchers wrote in their conclusion.

Gen. Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik that the move signals major changes in Turkish foreign policy. Russia has already started sharing its intelligence data with the Turkish army, which will ensure the effectiveness of Ankara's Euphrates Shield operation in Syria, Russia's Izvestia newspaper reported on Monday. According to the newspaper, the agreement was reached during recent negotiations between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan. First Deputy Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security at the Federation Council (upper house of parliament) Franz Klintsevich told the newspaper that Turkey quietly joined the intelligence sharing pool created by Russia, Syria, Iraq and Iran . ""We pass Turkey data on our radio intercepts, electronic intelligence and imagery intelligence that may be of interest to it,"" the senator said. ""In response, they also share information. Turkey has very effective intelligence agencies and very good agents in Syria ,"" he added. Commenting on the move, Retired Air Lieutenant General Erdogan Karakus, General President of TESUD (Turkey Retired Officers Association) told Sputnik Turkiye that the pace of development of Russian-Turkish relations amid the mounting tension in Turkish-American relations signifies major changes to Turkish foreign policy. Ankara is demonstrating its readiness to upgrade its cooperation with Moscow to an unprecedented level , creating prerequisites for further strategic partnerships, including in the military-political sphere. ""Turkey pays high importance to the Open Skies Treaty. Signed in 1992, it is aimed mainly at strengthening trust between the signatories,"" Erdogan Karakus told Sputnik. ""Unfortunately this February Turkey denied Russia an observation flight over its territory. However the situation has drastically changed since then and Russian inspectors now perform observation flights over Turkey . This is one of the major indications of a new stage in development of Russian-Turkish relations,"" he added. ""The exchange of intelligence data, negotiations on the creation of a Turkish anti-missile defense system with the deployment of Russia's S-300 and S-400 systems, the opening of its territory for observation flights signifies the growing trust in relations between the two countries,"" Karakus said. Retired Air Lieutenant General noted that such a development is only more natural as the American 'Greater Middle East' project equally worries both Russia and Turkey. To be able to prevent all the threats arising from this project the cooperation between the two countries should be ultimately upgraded to a strategic level. There are no hurdles for the further strategic partnership between the two, Karakus finally stated. Comment: This should pretty much put to rest any speculation that Ankara at risk of coming to the aid of the terrorists in eastern Aleppo. Russia would not develop such close ties with them if there was a risk Turkey would basically go to war against the Syrian army, and thus the Russians as well.

The company called for an explanation of ""under what set of circumstances"" the US authorities obtained users' private information. ""Citizens in a democracy require such information to understand and debate the appropriateness of such authorities and how the government employs them."" According to Yahoo, the report ""set a stronger precedent of transparency for our users and all citizens who could be affected by government requests for user data.

Order underscores, an unknown number of legal opinions and orders assessing the constitutionality of and statutory basis for the government's surveillance activities remain hidden from the public,"" the group said in its letter. According to the ACLU motion, ""judicial opinions interpreting constitutional and statutory limits on governmental authorities - including those relevance to foreign-intelligence surveillance - have regularly been available for inspection by the public ... their release is manifestly fundamental in a democracy committed to the rule of law."" The controversial document, which claims Yahoo built a custom software program to search all of its customers' incoming emails for specific information provided by US intelligence officials, was released October 4. The document, first reported by Reuters, said that a custom software program was secretly built in 2015 to comply with a classified US government directive. The program scanned hundreds of millions of Yahoo Mail accounts, according to the revelations. Under laws including the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, intelligence agencies can ask American phone and internet companies to provide customer data to aid foreign intelligence-gathering efforts for a variety of reasons, including prevention of terrorist attacks. But it wasn't until the disclosures by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and others who exposed the extent of electronic surveillance on the public that the US government was forced to scale back its program in order to protect privacy rights.

It was in place for five decades and, as measured by actions within the United Nations, served to isolate the United States, not Cuba,"" Earnest told reporters. ...",english,2016-10-26T21:14:17.845+03:00,sputniknews.com,RU,1616,"Washington's Embargo on Cuba Not Effective, Isolated US - White House",0,https://cdn2.img.sputniknews.com/images/101753/45/1017534538.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

L’hypothèse est moins surprenante qu’il n’y paraît. Elle pose néanmoins les questions de l’indépendance du Front vis-à-vis de son éventuel sponsor et du jeu d’influence que joueraient les EAU. 
La campagne de Marine Le Pen financée par Les Émirats Arabes Unis? C'est Médiapart qui a lancé l'info vendredi, bientôt reprise par toute la presse. Alors on peut bien sur se demander pourquoi le premier parti de France aux régionales et dans les intentions de vote à la présidentielle en est à rechercher des financements à l'étranger. On peut aussi trouver curieux qu'un parti que d'aucuns qualifient de xénophobe reçoive des fonds de pays arabes. 
Pourtant, ce rapprochement entre le Parti frontiste et les émiratis n'a rien de surprenant. © AP Photo/ Ariel Schalit Primaire de la droite: Jean-Frédéric Poisson sera-t-il exclu pour ses propos polémiques à l'occasion des « estivales de Fréjus» en septembre dernier, Wallerand de St-Just, le trésorier du Front National avait été clair au micro de France 3:
« S'il faut aller emprunter à l'étranger, nous irons emprunter à l'étranger, il n'y a aucune exclusive àça. Que ce soit en Russie en Argentine ou aux États-Unis […] Et pourquoi pas au Moyen-Orient. » 
Rappelons aussi que c'est déjà faute de trouver des banques françaises prêteuses que le FN avait emprunté 2 et 9 millions d'euros à des banques russes en 2014. D'ailleurs, le financement du FN n'est pas épargné par les péripéties juridiques. En septembre 2015, Wallerand de Saint-Just et Jean-François Jalkh, l'un des vice-présidents du parti, avaient été mis en examen pour recel d'abus de biens sociaux dans le cadre du financement de la campagne des présidentielles et des législatives de 2012, via le micro parti « Jeanne ». 
A propos du financement du FN, nous avons interrogé Gaëtan Dussausaye. Le Directeur national du Front National de la Jeunesse (FNJ) décrit une position claire et sans ambiguïté, qui ne dépend pas « des nécessités de financement » de la campagne électorale: 
« Ce financement, nous le cherchons partout. Comme les banques françaises se refusent à prêter de l'argent à un parti politique — ce qui en soit est un véritable déni de démocratie — bien évidemment, on est contraints, on est obligés, d'aller chercher des financements à l'étranger ». 
Des financements qui ne sont pas dénués d'arrière-pensées, selon Médiapart, qui mentionne une source proche de Marine Le Pen. Cette source aurait affirmé que les émiratis voulaient, en échange de leur soutien financier, que Marine le Pen évince le Qatar pour travailler avec eux si elle était élue. 
Gaëtan Dussausaye estime qu'il y a peu de chances que la candidate du FN accepte le marché: 
« Le Front National est par définition un parti patriote. Nous sommes pour la souveraineté et l'indépendance de la France. On ne va pas chercher à se défaire des liens — poreux — qui existent avec l'Arabie Saoudite et le Qatar du fait des mandats de François Hollande et Nicolas Sarkozy […] pour se remettre sous l'influence d'un autre pays étranger. » 
Evincer le Qatar à leur profit serait en tout cas cohérent pour les Émirats Arabes Unis. En effet, le Qatar et les Frères musulmans figurent au tableau des ennemis héréditaires d'Abu Dhabi. De son côté, le FN oppose volontiers les EAU au Qatar et à l'Arabie Saoudite. Ces deux pétromonarchies ont particulièrement renforcés leurs liens économiques, politiques et diplomatiques avec la France sous les mandats respectifs de Nicolas Sarkozy et de François Hollande. Du pain béni pour le Front National, qui dénonce les collusions entre ces pays et les groupes extrémistes d'engeance wahhabite qui déchirent le Moyen-Orient. © AFP 2016 BERTRAND LANGLOIS Face au FN, Robert Ménard ""Oz sa droite"" Une opposition qui lui a d'ailleurs valu des déboires avec la Justice française:
En avril 2015, le Qatar avait porté plainte pour diffamation contre Florian Philippot, vice-président du Front national. Sa faute? Avoir critiqué le Qatar et l'Arabie Saoudite « Ces pays financent l'islamisme qui tue» sur Radio Classique et LCI, au lendemain des attentats de Charlie Hebdo. La plainte n'avait finalement pas aboutie, le Parlement européen refusant de lever l'immunité parlementaire de l'eurodéputé. 
Dans ce contexte, il n'apparait donc pas étonnant que le Front National s'en tienne à la ligne que nous expose Gaëtan Dussausaye: 
« Nous avons vu, au profit de l'émergence de Daech, un certain engagement de ces pays à lutter contre ce nouveau totalitarisme du XXIème siècle. Là où des pétromonarchies telles que le Qatar ou l'Arabie Saoudite jouent un jeu trouble, de la même manière qu'un pays à la porte de l'Europe comme la Turquie de monsieur Erdogan. Donc évidemment nous préférons être en relation avec des pays qui ont des engagements dans la lutte contre Daech beaucoup plus clairs, beaucoup plus transparents. » © AFP 2016 Kirill Kudryavsev Présidentielles: rien ne peut fléchir Nicolas Sarkozy, même un scandale financier En tout état de cause, il est certain que l'Arabie saoudite, le Qatar et les EAU mènent une vraie lutte d'influence en France à coups de pétrodollars. Les EAU sont même en tête des investissements privés en provenance du Golfe en France, alors que le Qatar et l'Arabie saoudite exercent plus leur emprise dans les milieux politiques et parfois diplomatiques. Une emprise dénoncée en mars dans un dossier-choc de Marianne .
Un investissement des EAU sur le FN pourrait constituer un moyen pour eux de peser —à terme — sur la politique française. Mais au vu des chances plus que minces de Marine le Pen aux présidentielles de 2017, les EAU ne vont-ils pas se décourager? Affaire à suivre.

Dans quel but?,"(mis à jour 19:05 26.10.2016) URL courte 15 2043 16 4 L’égérie ukrainienne Nadejda Savtchenko, libérée en mai dernier après deux ans de détention en Russie, y est revenue pour la première fois mercredi, alors que cela pourrait la faire accuser de haute trahison à son retour en Ukraine. 
Connue pour sa position intransigeante, Nadejda Savtchenko, députée de la Rada suprême (parlement) d'Ukraine, est venue à Moscou pour le procès en appel de ses compatriotes Stanislav Klykh et Mykola Karpiouk, qui se déroule à la Cour suprême de Russie, annonce sur Twitter Ilia Novikov, avocat de ces derniers. © Sputnik. Mikhail Voskresensky Nadejda Savtchenko revient à Moscou « Ces deux Ukrainiens ont été condamnés en mai à plus de 20 ans de prison par un tribunal de Tchétchénie pour avoir combattu contre les forces russes lors de la guerre dans cette république du Caucase dans les années 1990 », rappelle M. Novikov. 
La pilote militaire de 35 ans, qui purgeait une peine de 22 ans de prison en Russie pour avoir, selon des accusations qu'elle rejette, fourni à l'armée ukrainienne la position de deux journalistes de la télévision publique russe tués par un tir de mortier en juin 2014, a étééchangée fin mai contre deux Russes et a pu rentrer à Kiev, où elle a été accueillie en héroïne. Depuis, elle a fait de la libération des Ukrainiens détenus en Russie sa priorité. © Sputnik. Mikhail Palinchak Savtchenko bientôt à la tête d’une nouvelle révolution en Ukraine? « Même si je ne reviens pas vivante de Russie, j'irai quand même soutenir Mykola Karpiouk, Stanislav Klykh et tous nos gars qui restent en captivité en Russie et luttent pour l'Ukraine », a déclaré Nadejda Savtchenko, dans une vidéo publiée sur sa page Facebook. 
Quoi qu'il en soit, selon les sources kiéviennes du journal russe Kommersant, l'arrivée de Mme Savtchenko à Moscou n'est en réalité qu'un élément d'une campagne d'envergure lancée contre le président ukrainien Piotr Porochenko par différentes forces politiques, notamment par Ioulia Timochenko, ex-première ministre du pays et chef du groupe parlementaire Batkivchtchina. 
Un député du bloc de Piotr Porochenko à la Rada a estimé dans un entretien avec le quotidien russe que Mme Savtchenko comptait s'entendre avec les autorités russes sur la libération du journaliste Roman Souchtchenko, arrêté pour espionnage en Russie, et d'autres ressortissants ukrainiens emprisonnés ou attendant leurs procès dans ce pays. « En cas de réussite, Mme Timochenko qui compte Nadejda Savtchenko parmi les membres de son groupe parlementaire, pourra accuser le président d'incapacitéà défendre les Ukrainiens emprisonnés en Russie. Et son parti Batkivchtchina insistera encore plus sur une élection présidentielle anticipée », a déclaré l'interlocuteur de Kommersant. © Sputnik. Eugene Kotenko Seuls 19,5% des Ukrainiens prêts à réélire le président Porochenko 
Et d'ajouter que l'entourage du chef de l'État avait très mal réagi à la visite de Mme Savtchenko en Russie, pays agresseur. « Nous ne croyons pas une seule minute que Mme Savtchenko se soit rendue en Russie sans avoir reçu des garanties préalables de sa non-arrestation à la frontière », a indiqué la source du journal russe. 
Néanmoins, Dimitri Peskov, porte-parole du président russe, a déclaré que l'arrivée de Nadejda Savtchenko n'avait pas été concertée avec le Kremlin, cela n'étant « pas nécessaire ». « Toute la procédure juridique concernant Mme Savtchenko a été remplie. Elle peut à tout moment entrer en Russie et en sortir. Il n'y a rien à commenter là-dessus », a expliqué aux journalistes M. Peskov. 
On apprend que le chef adjoint du groupe Front populaire à la Rada Iouri Bereza a déjà exigé que, suite au voyage de Nadejda Savtchenko à Moscou, on lui ferme l'accès aux secrets d'État, en l'excluant du Comité de sécurité nationale.

La vie en Europe est complexe…,"6 329 2 5 Les volontaires qui aident les réfugiés en Europe, sont-ils vraiment des complices de terroristes? Depuis le début de la crise migratoire, les Européens se posent de nouvelles questions en matière de sécurité. Ces craintes sont parfois poussées jusqu’à l’absurde. Une bénévole hongroise risque même une peine de prison. 
L'arrivée massive des migrants a divisé les Européens dont certains craignent, et non sans raison, la montée du terrorisme. Mais ces craintes sont parfois poussées jusqu'à l'absurde. Une volontaire de Budapest, Adele Nagy, 38 ans, risque d'être condamnée à 20 ans de prison pour avoir aidé les réfugiés. « J'ai collecté des vêtements, des produits alimentaires, des médicaments et des produits d'hygiène pour femmes. Mes amis m'ont trahie, ils croyaient que j'aidais les terroristes et m'ont dénoncé aux autorités. En Hongrie, je risque d'écoper de vingt ans de prison. Je suis donc partie pour les Emirats arabes unis », a indiqué Adele Nagy cité par la chaîne de télévision RT. © AP Photo/ Muhammed Muheisen Les réfugiés afghans «déçus» par la vie en Europe Selon Adele Nagy, le gouvernement hongrois considère les réfugiés comme des terroristes potentiels et les médias en persuadent les habitants locaux. Plusieurs Hongrois ont déjàété condamnés à des amendes et même à des peines de prison pour leur bontéà l'égard des migrants. « La plupart des Hongrois détestent les musulmans uniquement en raison des fausses informations qu'on diffuse. Mais je crois que nous devons aider les réfugiés parce qu'ils se trouvent dans une situation difficile, leur pays natal est en proie à une guerre », a ajouté Mme Nagy. 
Les Européens qui sympathisent avec les migrants reconnaissent qu'il peut y avoir des criminels parmi les réfugiés, mais ils sont plutôt confiants, d'après la mère d'une étudiante de Berlin, Jana Olernikova. « Ma fille (…) donne des cours d'allemand aux enfants des réfugiés syriens et afghans à Vienne et à Bratislava. Elle a beaucoup d'amis parmi les migrants (…). Je ne dirais pas que je crains de me promener dans les rues depuis le début de la crise. Il peut sans doute y avoir des criminels parmi les migrants, mais il y en a aussi parmi les Européens. Je suis contente que je puisse voir la vie arabe, j'aime la diversité culturelle en Europe », a indiqué Jana Olernikova. © AFP 2016 PHILIPPE HUGUEN Calais: «Les réfugiés ont le droit d’avoir une vie heureuse» Selon Miriam Dusterhoft, bénévole au camp de réfugiés de l'association humanitaire ASB en Allemagne, l'arrivée des migrants est une nouvelle occasion pour les Européens de faire preuve de souplesse. « Je porte une jupe longue ou un pantalon. Je couvre mes bras. Mais c'est une décision personnelle, j'ai beaucoup de tatouages et je ne veux pas gêner les gens qui n'y sont pas habitués. Je ne crois pas que mes droits soient lésés, je porte ce que je veux en ville », a précisé la volontaire. 
Selon l'agence Frontex, plus de 1,8 million de migrants sont arrivés en Europe en 2015. Ce flux de réfugiés a compliqué la vie des habitants locaux. Les problèmes causés par la présence d'un grand nombre de migrants font réagir les autorités. En France, le démantèlement du camp des réfugiés de Lande, aussi baptisé la Jungle, a commencé le 24 octobre. Les migrants seront relogés dans des centres d'accueil en France ou transférés vers d'autres pays européens.

Après « Un président ne devrait pas dire ça », qui éclabousse Hollande, c’est « Un Fantasme nommé Juppé » qui se retourne contre son auteur. Dans les deux cas, leur livre révèle surtout le manque de vision de ces politiciens. 
Wesh, Péju, trop de la balle le mec, ou quoi ? Trop chanmé, sérieux, comment qu'il les calcule pas les condés ! T'ain, j'le prenais pour un bouffon, deux de tension, trop cheum, tu vois, mais y déchire sa race, le cousin ! 
Eh oui, Juppé, il ne lui manque plus que le sweat capuche, la casquette des Chicago Bulls avec une plaque en simili métal et les chaînes autour du cou. Tel le djeune de base emmerdé par les flics dans ses petits trafics — pardon, dans son activité d'entrepreneur indépendant —, voilà-t'y pas que notre Ali-du 9-3-larchourma-de-ta-vie — ah voilà que ça me reprend — confesse toute la détestation que lui inspirent les flics et les juges. C'est dans un livre à paraître, Un Fantasme nommé Juppé , mais dont mes confrères n'ont pas hésitéà divulguer quelques bonne feuilles. 
Monsieur le Premier ministre me pardonnera ma familiarité, c'est bien lui qui affirmait, dans un effort de coolitude assez déplacé quand on l'air comme lui de faire un usage plutôt déplacé des balais, qu'il « emmerdait » ceux qui le trouvaient ennuyeux, je vous en parlais d'ailleurs il y a quelque temps. 
Donc le candidat favori des Français, selon ses propres mots, s'apparente donc à un Black Block de base qui scande en marge des manifs Loi travail « tout le monde déteste la police ». Oui, mais pas que. Dans son bouquin, notre énarque assoiffé de pouvoir explique qu'il n'aime donc pas l'intérieur, la justice, mais pas non plus le ministère des Finances « où il n'y a que des coups à prendre ». Sous Sarkozy, il ne voulait même pas du Quai d'Orsay, expliquant au président « Je ne veux pas porter ton cartable ». 
Bref, rien n'est assez bien pour lui, « le meilleur d'entre nous » ne se voit que sur le trône élyséen. Grattez un peu et sous la couche de coolitude, l'animal à sang froid réapparaît rapidement. Comme la plupart de ses petits camarades, Alain Juppé n'est intéressé que par le pouvoir. Mais pour en faire quoi ? Pas forcément pour appliquer des idées dites « de droite » si l'on en croit cette confession : « J'ai été de droite pour prouver qu'on pouvait être intelligent et de droite ! » Ou pas, donc. 
D'ailleurs, il suffit de se pencher un peu sur son action pour que le vernis « de droite » craque aussi légèrement. Quel homme de droite — quel républicain sensé, d'ailleurs — entretiendrait des liens aussi étroits avec l'UOIF, c'est-à-dire les Frères musulmans, comme le fait Alain Juppé ? Rappelons qu'il a remis la Légion d'Honneur à l'imam Tareq Oubrou, membre de l'UOIF et ami de Tariq Ramadan en août dernier. 
Je me réfère également au témoignage d'Amine Elbahi, un jeune ex-soutien du candidat bordelais. Bel exemple d'intégration, le jeune homme s'était engagé dans la réserve citoyenne de l'Éducation nationale et dans les Républicains, aux côtés d'Alain Juppé. « Rester à ses côtés serait renier mes convictions. » explique maintenant Amine Elbahi, qui déplore qu'Alain Juppé travaille aux côtés des salafistes de l'UOIF, comme Amar Lasfar, Tareq Obrou, Ahmed Miktar, qui tous prônent un islam politique incompatible avec nos valeurs françaises et républicaines. 
Oui, le pouvoir pour faire quoi ? On ne sait pas trop donc. Pour l'exercer, tout simplement, tout comme l'actuel locataire de l'Élysée qui lui aussi est là pour le plaisir d'être là et non pour porter une vision. Autre point commun entre les deux hommes : ils ont sorti des livres d'entretiens qu'ils auraient mieux fait de relire avant publication. Le scandale (dans un verre d'eau) du bouquin de Juppé n'ayant pas encore effacé celui du bien nommé« Un président ne devrait pas dire ça » de Hollande, vous avez encore ne mémoire les propos peu amènes du Corrézien de service à propos de la magistrature (tiens encore un point commun), de l'immigration ou de l'islam. 
Eh bien devinez quoi, ce n'est pas de sa faute, à Hollande ! Ce sont les méchants journalistes qui l'ont pousséà la faute ! Tu parles, en 62 entretiens et 10 dîners, ils ont le temps de le pousser, pépère ! et c'est Jean Glavany qui nous l'affirme : 
« … ils savaient depuis le début qu'ils gagneraient d'autant plus d'argent qu'ils pousseraient le président à la faute. Alors ils l'ont poussé, poussé, poussé… et il est tombé, tombé, tombé dans le piège. » 
Pauvre pépère, il n'a pas fait exprès ! En tout cas, il y en a un qui n'est pas content, c'est Alain Juppé, parce que cette excuse bidon pour des propos foireux dans un livre probablement lamentable, elle est déjà prise, maintenant !",french,2016-10-26T21:17:59.424+03:00,sputniknews.com,RU,1616,"Juppé, comme tout le monde, déteste la police !",0,https://cdnfr2.img.sputniknews.com/images/102811/56/1028115633.png,0,0,5,0,5,bs

We will work closely with the government of the Philippines to address any concerns they may have.” 
She emphasized that the countries’ military-to-military relationship remains robust and multifaceted, including joint work on matters of national security as well as responses to natural disasters and other crises. 
The State Department spokeswoman’s remarks follow statements by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte earlier Wednesday that all foreign military forces would be withdrawn from his country within two years. “We’ve seen a lot of this sort of troubling rhetoric recently, and this is not a positive trend,” Mason said. “This recent string of comments does not reflect the warmth, breadth and depth of the US-Philippines partnership.” © REUTERS/ Ng Han Guan/Pool Philippines Turning Away From 'Unilateral Ties' With US to 'Diversified Contacts' With China, Russia Mason stressed that Washington is fully confident that bilateral relations remain strong, including in trade, investment and remittances. “As we have stated, we continue to focus on our broad relationship with the Philippines and will work together in the many areas of mutual interest to improve the livelihoods of the Philippine people and uphold our shared democratic values,” she explained. 
Duterte made his statement during a three-day visit to Japan, Mason noted. “We welcome the Philippines having strong, productive relationships with other neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region,” she said. “This is not a zero-sum game; we don’t think that the Philippines, or indeed any country, should choose between good relations with the US and with another partner.” 
Duterte recently said it was time for Manila to ""say goodbye"" to the United States’ long use of Philippine land for military bases, and on a visit to Beijing he announced his country was separating from the United States in order to realign with China. ...",english,2016-10-26T21:24:54.393+03:00,sputniknews.com,RU,1616,US Expects Philippines to Honor Alliance Commitments Despite Harsh Rhetoric,0,https://cdn5.img.sputniknews.com/images/104677/07/1046770771.jpg,0,0,2,1,2,bs

""Russia bears significant expenses because of the sanctions. I always mention the figure from 0.8 percent to 1 percent of the GDP growth that is not achieved… annually.

Speaking to representatives of the Association of European Businesses in Moscow on Tuesday, Russia's top diplomat explained how Western countries have absolutely contradictory approaches to virtually identical problems in Yemen and Ukraine. 
At the meeting, Lavrov devoted a great deal of his speech to the subject of the crisis in Ukraine, the issue which effectively sparked the crisis in relations between Western countries and Russia, and resulted in tens of billions of dollars in economic losses for both sides, not to mention heightened military tensions. © Sputnik/ Vladimir Sergeev Saving Face: 'West's Attitude to Crimea Will Not Change' After US Elections Pointing out the difference in approach to Western policy in response to the crises in Ukraine and that in present-day Yemen, the foreign minister effectively schooled Western officials for their illogical behavior.
Lavrov recalled that when Yemen faced a coup in September 2014, and Yemeni President Hadi fled to neighboring Saudi Arabia, Western politicians reacted by demanding the reinstatement of the country's legitimate president. However, facing the exact same situation in Ukraine in February 2014, US and European leaders reacted very differently. ""For over two years, the international community has been demanding that President Hadi be returned to Yemen and his legitimacy be reaffirmed,"" Lavrov recalled. ""But our European colleagues, who share this view, remain silent when we ask them why the same principled approach cannot be applied to Ukraine."" 
Lavrov pointed out that two-and-a-half years ago, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Poland brokered a deal between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and the opposition, promising early elections in exchange for his security and an end to riots in the streets of Kiev. But just hours after the deal was signed, Yanukovych was ousted, and forced to flee in fear for his life.

Russian Defense Ministry Russian Caspian Flotilla Ships Successfully Complete Kalibr Missile Drill This week the 47th Session of the Special Working Group (SWG) on the development of the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea met in Tehran, where deputy foreign ministers of the Caspian states met to discuss a possible agreement on the Sea's status.
Since 1991, the five Caspian Sea countries have made agreements on a range of areas including the environment, the protection of marine resources, security, co-operation in the case of emergency situations and military activities in the lake. 
In practice, they have come to agreement regarding the division of the water surface into sovereign zones. According to this agreement, the five Caspian countries have the right to exploit marine resources up to 25 miles from their coast. This includes 15 nautical miles which constitutes national waters, plus another ten nautical miles in which each state has the exclusive right to fishing. The rest of the water is considered international. 
Political analyst Vladimir Sazhin told Sputnik Persian that while the Caspian Sea countries have made a lot of progress on the issue, a final Convention is still far from being agreed. 
""I will say straightaway that for the moment the prospect is extremely remote. At the moment the legal framework for the Caspian Sea is based on two agreements signed by Iran and the Soviet Union in 1921 and 1940,"" Sazhin said. 
""Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, three new littoral states established after the collapse of the Soviet Union, do not recognize these agreements and are holding discussions about the future status of the sea."" 
""Of course, this is justified because after all there are now five, not two independent Caspian states, each of which has an equal right to this sea-lake, on the basis of their geographical location,"" Sazhin explained. © Sputnik/ Baku Summit to Enrich Persian Gulf With Caspian Sea Resources The issue of whether the Caspian Sea is actually a lake or a sea is at the core of many of the disagreements, since the two bodies of water are governed differently under international law.
Iran is convinced that the Caspian is a lake, and should be divided equally five ways, giving Tehran control over 20 percent of the water and sea bed. 
However, Iran's four neighbors in the Caspian insist that, as reflected by its name, the body of water is really a sea. Therefore, they argue, the water and sea bed should be divided according to a modified median line. 
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan have all signed agreements according to this principle. However, since Iran's Exclusive Economic Zone would constitute only 13 percent of the sea according to this principle, the proposal is rejected by Tehran. 
Azerbaijan to the west of Iran and Turkmenistan to the east reject in turn Tehran's idea, which would deprive them of maritime territory. ...",english,2016-10-26T22:01:09.463+03:00,sputniknews.com,RU,1616,Tehran's 'Big Lake' Claim Muddies the Waters in Caspian Sea Dispute,0,https://cdn4.img.sputniknews.com/images/104677/16/1046771680.jpg,0,0,4,0,4,bs

""The idea is to provide a solution to a capability gap which is an inability to acquire, track and destroy low, slow drones that proliferate all over the world,"" said Tim Reese, director of strategic planning, according to Business Insider . 
Mounted on US Army Stryker vehicles, the lasers will likely be used to shoot down enemy drones. The weapon could also be fine-tuned to target incoming munitions. 
""The energy of the laser damages, destroys and melts different components of the target,"" Reese said. ""We’ve clearly demonstrated you can take out UAVs pretty effectively,"" Mary Miller, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Research and Technology, added. ""Now we are not only working on how we take out UAVs but also mortars and missiles – and eventually cruise missiles."" Scared of Russian BMPs, US Strykers in Europe to Get 30mm Guns 
Laser weapons offer a number of benefits. Ammunition, for instance, is virtually unlimited, so long as enough power can be generated to create a beam. The USS Ponce was one of the first US military units to be fitted with a mounted laser weapon, since a ship can easily mobilize the large power generators necessary. Stationary laser weapons have also been placed at military bases for the same reason. Shrinking these power sources to fit a vehicle as small as a Stryker was a unique challenge. 
Even with the high-energy requirements, lasers are comparatively cost-effective. 
""The shot per kill (with lasers) is very inexpensive when the alternative is sending out a multi-million dollar missile,"" Miller said.

Pyongyang has conducted over 20 ballistic missile tests this year and two nuclear explosions. There is concern in Washington that the DPRK could be developing a weapon that could reach the American mainland. Their most recent underground nuclear explosion took place in early September. © AP Photo/ Wong Maye-E US Still Committed to Denuclearization Process in North Korea At the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said ""I think the notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause…They are not going to do that — that is their ticket to survival."" 
Washington has consistently maintained its position on not recognizing North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. Numerous sanctions, and negotiations to trade aid in exchange for disarmament have not stopped Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Despite this, the US State Department announced that it will continue to demand the communist country’s denuclearization.

Following the bird’s revelations, the man’s wife filed a complaint with the Hawally Police Department, accusing her husband of deception. She had long suspected that there was an improper relationship between him and the maid. Bird-en of Proof: Parrot's 'Testimony' Could Help Solve Michigan Murder Case Luckily for the husband, the case was thrown out based on lack of credible evidence, as the parrot could not testify in court. Investigators also explained that it could not be conclusively proven that the bird was mimicking a conversation it heard in person — and not just some flirty scene that had played on television.
In Kuwait, adultery is illegal and can carry a sentence of hard labor or even prison time, the India Times reports. 
In 2006, a woman in Leeds was busted for infidelity after her boyfriend’s parrot began squawking “I love you Gary.” Gary, it turned out, was an ex-colleague of the woman’s. After being confronted with the parrot’s phrases the girlfriend admitted to the affair. 
The parrot also made smooching noises when it heard the name Gary. Though the girlfriend moved out, the parrot’s owner had to get rid of the bird as well, as it would not stop repeating the name of the homewrecker, and became a painful reminder. ""I wasn't sorry to see the back of Suzy after what she did, but it really broke my heart to let Ziggy go,"" the jilted boyfriend told BBC at the time.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has claimed the election is rigged and called for his supporters, including police and sheriffs, to independently patrol polling places for voter fraud, sparking at least some concerns that minority voters could be subject to intimidation. 
Trump, but also numerous other critics , have warned of mass voter fraud in light of the fact that no mechanism exists to verify individuals are legally entitled to vote or keep people from voting more than once. Moreover, critics have raised the issue of names of dead people being included on voter lists as well as voting machines being highly vulnerable to manipulation and hacking.

In 2007, Donald Trump was granted a coveted spot on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work on his reality show, “The Apprentice.” With limited real estate, the decision to enshrine reality stars on the sidewalk has always been controversial. 
Trump’s star has become especially unwelcome. — MEFeater Magazine (@mefeater) October 26, 2016 
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a man dressed as a city worker used a sledgehammer and pickaxe to deface the presidential hopeful’s star, removing the brass star and scraping his name from the sidewalk. — Ol' QWERTY Bastard (@TheDiLLon1) October 26, 2016 
According to Deadline , the vandal has been identified as Jamie Otis, who said he intended to remove the entire section of sidewalk in order to sell it at auction. Proceeds, he said, would go toward supporting the multiple women who have accused Trump of sexual assault. 
The stars are maintained by the Hollywood Historic Trust, and the group has already said that the individual responsible will be prosecuted ""to the full extent of the law,"" and repairs are already underway. — Adelle Nazarian (@AdelleNaz) October 26, 2016 
""The Hollywood Walk of Fame is an institution celebrating the positive contributions of the inductees,"" said Leron Gubler, head of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, according to Deadline. ""When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark."" 
If found guilty, the individual responsible could face up to three years in jail and a fine of $10,000. 
The Trump star has been vandalized on a number of occasions since he began his presidential campaign. In January, a vandal spray-painted a reverse swastika over the star. — afterglow (@afterglow2046) October 26, 2016

La portavoz del PSOE, Isabel Rodríguez, afirmó respecto al discurso de Rajoy que ""le ha faltado autocrítica y le ha sobrado triunfalismo"". 
""No puede hablar de pensiones ni educación después de haber recortado en ambas cosas"", aseguró la política. ""Hemos visto a un Rajoy triunfante en el diálogo, pero el país no está para eso, hay mucho que hacer"", insistió. © REUTERS/ Sergio Perez El debate de investidura de Mariano Rajoy La portavoz socialista también hizo alusión a las continuas llamadas al diálogo y al consenso en el discurso del líder conservador.
""Llega tarde para el diálogo, en concreto llega cinco años tarde, después de que muchas personas hayan sufrido con austeridad y recortes las consecuencias de su falta de diálogo"", afirmó en rueda de prensa. 
Por su parte, el portavoz de Podemos, Iñigo Errejón, también criticó el discurso de Rajoy que, según el político de izquierdas, ""es el mismo que en la investidura fallida del mes de agosto"". ""Rajoy ha reiterado lo mismo que en el pasado debate, no hubo innovaciones, es el mismo guión. No propone nada nuevo, la novedad es lo que hará el PSOE, que le permitirá ser presidente"", insistió Errejón, que recalcó en varias ocasiones que el PP volverá a ocupar el Gobierno gracias a la abstención de los socialistas. 
Cruces de acusaciones en la oposición © REUTERS/ Sergio Perez Rajoy anuncia el inicio de una ""nueva etapa política"" basada en el diálogo El Comité Federal del PSOE decidió el pasado domingo abstenerse en la segunda votación de investidura del conservador Mariano Rajoy para permitir al líder del Partido Popular (PP) formar Gobierno y evitar la celebración de unas terceras elecciones en España.
En concreto, el máximo órgano interno del PSOE aprobó una resolución que contempla oponerse a la investidura de Mariano Rajoy en la primera votación para mostrar ""su rechazo frontal a las políticas del PP"" pero que indica a sus diputados que deben ""abstenerse en la segunda votación"" para ""desbloquear la excepcional situación institucional que sufre el país"". 
De esta manera, el PSOE, principal partido de la socialdemocracia española y líder de la oposición, entrega el poder por primera vez en la historia del país a su máximo rival histórico, el conservador Partido Popular.

Ante esta situación, Podemos considera que deben ser ellos (la tercera fuerza en el Congreso) los que lideren la oposición, dado que son los que no han permitido que Rajoy siga en el Gobierno. ""Es difícil liderar la oposición y al mismo tiempo poner a Mariano Rajoy en el Ejecutivo. Nosotros al PP le decimos que no y vamos a seguir representando un modelo alternativo al del PP"", insistió Errejón, en referencia a la decisión del PSOE. 
Sin embargo, por su parte, el PSOE defiende que ellos van a ""liderar la oposición"".

En ese sentido, explicó que la celebración de unas terceras elecciones en medio de un año serían ""perjudiciales para el país"" y solicitó la confianza de la cámara para formar Gobierno y de ese modo evitar unos comicios que ""dañarían"" la imagen exterior española. 
El líder conservador defendió que un Gobierno presidido por él es lo ""más razonable"" porque los españoles colocaron al Partido Popular como fuerza más votada en las pasadas elecciones de junio y en los comicios de diciembre de 2015. ""Parece justo y razonable que quienes de verdad no desean repetir las elecciones apoyen esta solución"", dijo sobre al resto de fuerzas sobre su propia investidura. 
A pesar de su invitación al diálogo, el candidato advirtió al resto de grupos parlamentarios de que ""no dará marcha atrás"" en las grandes reformas llevadas a cabo por su Gabinete en los últimos cuatro años, entre las que se encuentra una polémica reforma laboral. 
No obstante, Rajoy invitó a todos los parlamentarios a ""abordar en común"" los retos más importantes de su agenda, entre los que, además de citar cuestiones como el elevado desempleo, destacó al ""desafío secesionista que algunos están planteando en Cataluña"" como el más relevante. 
""Mi obligación es defender la soberanía nacional, la unidad de España y el respeto a la ley"" afirmó tajante el candidato. — Partido Popular (@PPopular) 26 октября 2016 г. 
En el marco de su discurso de talante dialogante, Rajoy se mostró abierto a buscar acuerdos sobre el encaje de Cataluña en España que puedan satisfacer alguno de los anhelos del soberanismo, pero advirtió que ""nadie puede privar al pueblo español de su derecho exclusivo a decidir sobre su futuro y sobre su territorio"".

Resulta que el candidato Obama recibió el apoyo de la Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN), que funciona en 100 ciudades en EEUU y tiene unos 500.000 miembros dedicados al apoyo a los más necesitados.

​El 'think tank' Pew Research Center, con sede en Washington, encontró también irregularidades en las elecciones en el 2012, en las cuales fue elegido Barack Obama. Resultó que cada octavo votante registrado no podía emitir su voto. En aquel entonces, más de 1,5 millones de votantes muertos 'depositaron' su voto y unos 2,75 millones de habitantes participaron dos veces en la votación. Tomando en cuenta todos estos antecedentes históricos, no son nada extrañas o exageradas las sospechas del actual candidato republicano Donald Trump de que las elecciones del próximo 8 de noviembre puedan ser fraudulentas, especialmente en Chicago, Filadelfia o Saint Louis. También Trump está sospechando que los 51 millones de ciudadanos norteamericanos no registrados (24% de los potenciales votantes) podrían ser utilizados para el robo de votos. © REUTERS/ Dave Kaup El sistema quiere imponer a Hillary en la Presidencia Recientemente la organización Project Veritas Action, cuya misión es ""investigar y exponer la corrupción, deshonestidad, fraudes"", dirigida por el activista conservador James E. O'Keefe III, lanzó el tercer vídeo sobre el fraude electoral confirmando la participación de Hillary Clinton. En el primer vídeo, se muestra cómo los organizadores de la campaña de Clinton están usando la violencia para desacreditar los mítines y reuniones de los partidarios de Trump. En el segundo vídeo, se expone paso por paso la estrategia del Partido Demócrata para lograr el fraude electoral a favor de Hillary que en general habían usado los demócratas durante los últimos 50 años. Finalmente, en el tercer documento filmado se presentan las comunicaciones electrónicas entre Clinton, la Convención Nacional Demócrata y la ONG American Unites for Change para organizar eventos políticos desacreditando a Trump.
También la táctica de ensuciar al candidato rival no es nada nueva para los demócratas. La penúltima vez la usaron contra Mitt Romney en 2012, cuando los medios globalizados lo presentaron como un 'racista diabólico', un 'sexista brutal' que quiere que las mujeres retornen a la sumisión de los años 50, 'viejo homofóbico' etc. Entonces los actuales insultos a Trump, como 'estúpido', 'ignorante', 'racista', 'sexista' o 'delincuente sexual', 'vicioso' es parte del juego electoral incorporado por los medios de comunicación globalizados y corporativos para la promoción del candidato seleccionado por el Sistema o el establishment y la destrucción de su contrincante, que no satisface en este momento las necesidades y las aspiraciones de aquel 1% de los dueños de América. © REUTERS/ Brian Snyder Donald Trump, el bufón útil del Sistema Norteamericano De allí surge el dilema. Ambos candidatos, tanto Hillary como Donald han sido lanzados al ruedo electoral por el sistema con el propósito inicial de utilizar a Trump para facilitar la victoria de Clinton. Sin embargo, los propósitos del sistema podrían variarse debido a la dinámica de la campaña electoral, surgimiento de cambios geopolíticos en el mundo o las condiciones económicas tanto internas como externas y la flexibilidad de adaptación de cada candidato a las nuevas necesidades políticas y las expectativas del momento. Lo que está absolutamente claro es que los dos candidatos trabajan para el mismo 1%, es decir, para el sistema.

A la vez, el hombre de confianza de la familia Rothschild, el multimillonario Wilbur Ross organizó un 'lunch' que costaba 25,000 dólares el plato para apoyar al candidato Trump.

El periodista Andrew St. George reveló en 'The Spotlight' (30 de octubre 1978) que Resorts International fue controlado por los hombres de las familias Rockefeller y Rothschild y administrado por los agentes de la CIA y Mossad que, en los años 60, usaban el dinero lavado para financiar la lucha contra la Cuba de Fidel Castro.

En fin, todo esto demuestra que tanto Donald Trump como Hillary Clinton trabajan para el sistema o como se dice popularmente en EEUU, para los 'bad guys'. El problema ahora consiste en seleccionar al líder más útil actualmente para el establishment norteamericano. El discurso internacional de Hillary, apodada 'The Queen of War and Chaos' está aparentemente cargado de amenazas de guerra. Ella misma se da cuenta de que Estados Unidos no está preparado para una confrontación con Rusia y China.

​El candidato republicano declaró recientemente: ""Bajo mi administración pondremos fin a la débil política exterior de los últimos ocho años, reconstruiremos nuestras Fuerzas Armadas, le daremos a nuestros soldados reglas de combate claras"". Y en una reunión en Phoenix, Trump aclaró, para que nadie se hiciera ilusiones de su aparente pacifismo: ""Yo soy más militarista que todos los que están reunidos en la esta sala"". Hillary Clinton está amenazando a Venezuela y Donald Trump ya anunció en un mitin en Miami, adoptando la postura de Benito Mussolini, que acabaría con la dictadura de Castro en Cuba y con la de Maduro en Venezuela.

El ataque rusófobo ha asumido un carácter tan delirante que ha provocado un efecto contrario. En lugar de odio, curiosidad. En lugar de desprecio, admiración. Al menos así lo ve el escritor y periodista italiano Giulietto Chiesa en su artículo de opinión para Sputnik. 
El intento de los medios y apoderados occidentales de demonizar la figura de Vladímir Putin solo aumenta la popularidad internacional del líder ruso y lo convierte en el termómetro de una derrota, un 'auto de fe' del periodismo occidental. 
Chiesa pone de relieve que los centros destinados al control de la opinión pública occidental muestran signos de gran desconcierto. ""El ejército invisible de cientos de miles de propagandistas ya no parece ser capaz de producir y reproducir suficientes toxinas para envenenar al público europeo. Mientras que el mensaje que brinda el 'enemigo' declarado parece ser cada vez más sugestivo"". © Sputnik/ Vladímir Trefilov V Международная научная конференция ""Зиновьевские чтения"" 
Por ejemplo, para un número creciente de personas es cada vez más claro que Rusia ha sido el factor decisivo en la derrota del autodenominado Estado Islámico en Irak y Siria. Es así que Rusia ha ayudado a Europa en la lucha contra el terrorismo internacional. Es así que Putin resulta ser un amigo y no un enemigo. © Sputnik/ Evgeny Odinokov ""Los medios occidentales hacen de Rusia un espantajo"" 
La idea de los asesinos 'comisionados' por Putin permanece fija en la memoria de muchos lectores/espectadores, pero para muchos otros —los que realmente indagan en el tema y cuyo número sigue creciendo— esto se convierte en poco más que un invento de los medios de comunicación, que no se sostiene por prueba consistente alguna y que, evidentemente, no se corresponde con la realidad. Las historias de una inminente invasión rusa en el Báltico y Polonia están bastante expandidas entre las poblaciones locales, pero resultan ridículas para millones de europeos. ""Las sanciones contra Rusia no han encontrado apoyo en Europa y muchos son los que no se explican por qué los líderes europeos han decidido ir en contra de sus propios intereses económicos"".

En resumen, los hechos desmienten las conjeturas. Ahora solo les queda aumentar la dosis propagandística, como la del obsesionado Joe Biden, el vicepresidente de Estados Unidos, quien en la televisión llegó incluso a acusar a Rusia de poder y querer ""alterar sustancialmente"" el resultado de las elecciones en Estados Unidos. Pero se trata de un gol en su propia puerta, mostrando a EEUU como víctima de una agresión tecnológica de Rusia. La credibilidad de esa acusación es igual a cero (más que nada porque todo el mundo sabe que provienen del país que ha inventado las 'revoluciones de color' en una docena de países). © Sputnik/ Alexey Druzhinin ""Nuevo orden de Rusia y China sustituirá la hegemonía de EEUU"" 
Las redes sociales son todas estadounidenses y trabajaban sin descanso por su causa, pero ahora nos traen mensajes contradictorios. Existe RT, que acumula alrededor de sí a todos los que aún no tienen el celebro lavado. Se ha roto así la línea de monopolio informativo y comunicativo. Y aquí es cuando se traza la nueva línea: 'detener la propaganda' del Kremlin, dado que nuestra propaganda no funciona como debe. Así, lo primero es reforzar el dogma según el cual todo lo proveniente ""de aquella parte"" es propaganda. 
El segundo punto del plan: evitar que el canal del enemigo funcione, erigiendo barreras técnicas, políticas, administrativas, judiciales, policiales; detener a los periodistas enemigos (o matarlos, como en Ucrania); cerrar cuentas bancarias de RT en Gran Bretaña ; oscurecer las redes de radio y televisión en las que salen al aire las herejías del Kremlin. 
""Somos testigos de la implementación de la censura en Occidente, que tanto se jactaba de su libertad y su pluralismo. Los papeles se han invertido. La confrontación de ideas, las más duras, difíciles, pero útiles para verificar las diferencias, vienen siendo sustituidas por la prohibición.

En un enroque en dos altos cargos del Estado, la iniciativa contempla que la procuradora saliente, quien también es senadora con licencia para desempeñar el cargo de fiscal, ha sido designada a la Secretaría de la Función Pública, cargo que también debe analizar el Senado. Renuncia secretario federal de la Función Pública de México La titular saliente de la Procuradora General de la República (PGR Fiscalía federal), asumió el cargo a principios de 2005, en remplazo de Jesús Murillo, que fracasó cuando se derrumbó la llamada ""verdad histórica"" sobre la llamada Masacre de Iguala , perpetrada por policías y sicarios confabulados contra estudiantes de la escuela rural de Atoyotzinapa, que sigue sin esclarecerse.
En aquella ocasión, Gómez expresó que la PGR heredada era ""un desastre"" como institución federal contra el crimen. 
Ese cargo federal se encarga de auditar el desempeño de los funcionarios públicos con criterios de transparencia, vacante desde julio pasado cuando un amigo del presidente, Virgilio Andrade dejó el cargo anticorrupción. 
Más: Presidente Peña pide perdón a México por la ""Casa Blanca"" de su esposa 
Andrade dejó ese despacho cuando se aprobó el nuevo Sistema Nacional Anticorrupción , entre críticas de la oposición por haber exonerado al presidente mexicano en una investigación interna, por la llamada Casa Blanca de la primera dama, Angélica Rivera, una mansión de casi 4 millones de dólares construida y financiada por un amigo contratista del gobierno. 
El enroque Se forma una ""tormenta perfecta"" al final del mandato de Peña Nieto en México Gómez ha encarado otros casos paradigmáticos, como la fuga del jefe de Cartel de Sinaloa, Joaquín Guzmán , alias El Chapo, que se fugó por un túnel cavado hasta la celda del mafioso, cuando la procuradora fue fotografiada desconcertada, examinando la boca del pasadizo subterráneo del escape.
Una de las tareas inconclusas que deja Gómez es un paquete de juicios por corrupción que involucran a media docena de exgobernadores del gobernante Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), pero también uno de la oposición, que están prófugos por millonarias malversaciones al erario y sin rastro de ellos. 
Si es aprobado, el legislador Cervantes, de 53 años y con dos décadas de militancia en el PRI tendrá en su despacho los expedientes de líderes políticos caídos en desgracia de la clase política, cuyos hilos llegan a las alturas del poder.

""Es una persona que no merece estar dentro del PRI, con su comportamiento violó el código de ética"", dijo en su dictamen la Comisión de Honor y Justicia del longevo partido gobernante.

""Ha habido avances, pero limitados; los avances no se han producido en las cuestiones importantes"", dijo Habel, del Instituto de Altos Estudios de América Latina de la Universidad Sorbona III de París y señaló también que otro tema pendiente es la devolución a La Habana del territorio de Guantánamo. © REUTERS/ Alexandre Meneghini Bloqueo de EEUU a Cuba afecta también a ciudadanos norteamericanos Para la especialista, pese a las directivas del presidente de estadounidense Barack Obama para levantar ciertas restricciones, ""se mantienen los mecanismos que tienen como base debilitar al Gobierno cubano"".
El 14 de octubre, Obama anunció una serie de medidas que amplían el intercambio comercial entre ambos países. 
Entre las directrices más destacadas está el levantamiento a la restricción que prohibía a los barcos extranjeros que habían tocado puertos cubanos ingresar a territorio de EEUU para carga y descarga por un plazo de 180 días. 
Además, desde el 17 octubre se permite a los ciudadanos estadounidenses comprar en Cuba ron y habanos para uso personal e ingresarlo a EEUU como parte de su equipaje. 
Más: Bloqueo costó a Cuba más de 4.600 millones de dólares en un año 
Según Obama, el objetivo es que la apertura con Cuba sea ""irreversible"". 
Habel cuestionó sin embargo la actitud del mandatario estadounidense quien si bien tiene la ""voluntad para que no se vuelva hacia atrás, no toca temas importantes"". 
Temas pendientes 
Entre estos temas está el levantamiento del bloqueo, explica la especialista. ""El levantamiento del embargo depende del Congreso, pero hay medidas que Obama podría tomar y no tomó, como facilitar la importación de productos cubanos y el intercambio en dólares"", dijo Habel. © REUTERS/ Alexandre Meneghini Rusia insta al mundo a apoyar el fin del bloqueo de EEUU contra Cuba Respecto a la base militar de Guantánamo, la especialista francesa consideró que se trata de una situación ""increíble"" desde el punto de vista jurídico y recordó que documentos del Pentágono reconocen que Washington no quiere desprenderse de la base ""por miedo a que China se beneficie"" de la posibilidad de utilizar ese territorio.
El otro gran asunto pendiente en el que pese al llamado ""deshielo"" entre ambos países no hay propuestas concretas para su solución es el de la normativa migratoria conocida como ""ley de ajuste"" o política de ""pies secos y pies mojados"". 
Esa política garantiza la residencia en EEUU a los cubanos que logren pisar suelo estadounidense, mientras que determina la deportación de quienes sean encontrados en el mar. 
Lea también: Tema del bloqueo contra Cuba volverá a la ONU 
Las salidas de cubanos de su país se dispararon desde que Washington y La Habana reanudaron sus relaciones diplomáticas en julio del año pasado, pues muchos ciudadanos de la isla caribeña temen ahora perder esos privilegios migratorios que les ofrece Washington. 
Según Habel es una política que ""empuja a la inmigración"". 
""Cuba quiere poner fin a esta ley"", sostuvo la experta. 
Clinton-Trump Empresas de Trump pudieron haber violado el bloqueo comercial de EEUU a Cuba Las elecciones del próximo 8 de noviembre en EEUU marcarán el futuro de este deshielo entre La Habana y Washington.
Las perspectivas de continuar con el camino iniciado por Obama dependerán en gran medida quién se instale en la Casa Blanca el 1 de enero de 2017, si la demócrata Hillary Clinton o el republicano Donald Trump. 
Para la especialista francesa, de ganar, la ex secretaria de Estado ""no va a cambiar lo que Obama ha hecho"". 
""Con Clinton va a ser más fácil, pero no quiere decir que esté resuelto el tema"", agregó. 
En el caso de Trump, sostuvo, ""no sabemos qué puede ocurrir, porque ha dicho cosas contradictorias"". 
Sin embargo, para Habel, esta nueva etapa en las relaciones entre Cuba y EEUU no es un tema ""que oponga de por sí"" a demócratas y republicanos. ""Hay grupos de presión dentro del Partido Republicano que buscan el levantamiento del embargo y hay minorías dentro del Partido Demócrata en contra de las medidas de Obama"", afirmó. 
Este miércoles, en el marco de una nueva sesión de la Asamblea General de la ONU (Organización de las Naciones Unidas), Cuba pedirá por vigesimoquinta vez consecutiva el levantamiento del bloqueo.

Big Mistake: Priceless Space Artifact Was Sold at US Government Auction An Essex resident was given the gold coin by a grandfather when he was a child, as part of a collection of “treasure” from around the world that he could play pirate with. “My granddad had travelled all over the world during his working life and had collected many coins from the various countries he had been,” the anonymous owner told the Telegraph . “He gave me bags of coins to play with throughout my early years because I was into pirate treasure.” 
As time went on, the coins ended up packed away, until his grandfather’s passing, when the man rediscovered them. He then passed the coins on to his own son to play pirate. 
“I looked back through the coins – remembering the stories I made up about them when I was small — and then gave them to my own son to play with and put into his own treasure box. My little boy has been playing with this coin as I did all those years ago.” 
Curious to see if it was worth anything, the man took it to experts to see if it had any value. It turns out that the coin was one of fewer than 15 in existence. 
The coin was made from treasure seized from Spanish ships in Vigo Bay, Spain, in 1702, which was later pressed into coins and delivered to Sir Isaac Newton at the Royal Mint.

Zugleich werden immer mehr Fälle bekannt, wo sich Beamte zu den ""Reichsbürgern"" bekennen. Ein Paradoxon? © AFP 2016/ Ronny Hartmann Razzia in Bayern: „Reichsbürger“ schießt auf Polizisten – vier Verletzte Die Reichbürgerbewegung ist eine uneinheitliche Gruppe von Personen, die die Bundesrepublik als solche nicht anerkennen und sich das Deutsche Reich mit den Grenzen von 1937 zurückwünschen. Die „Reichsbürger“ gehen davon aus, dass das Deutsche Reich völkerrechtlich bis heute fortbestehe, da die Weimarer Reichsverfassung weder von den Nationalsozialisten noch von den alliierten Siegermächten des Zweiten Weltkriegs jemals abgeschafft wurde. Die Bundesrepublik sei hingegen nicht mit diesem identisch — somit verfassungsrechtlich, illegal und juristisch nicht existent.
Zu der Razzia im mittelfränkischen Ort Georgensgmünd, bei der durch die Schüsse des 49-jährigen Jägers einer der vier Einsatzkräfte des SEK ums Leben kam und drei verletzt wurden, erklärte der Innenminister von Bayern, Joachim Herrmann bei der Pressekonferenz am letzten Mittwoch folgendes: ""Ich will ausdrücklich hervorheben, dass es auch Reichbürger gibt, die nicht gewaltverdächtig und nicht unbedingt extremistisch anzusehen sind."" 
Alle Reichsdeutschen als rechtsextrem zu bezeichnen hält der ehemalige Oberstleutnant der Kriminalpolizei und Rechtsextremismus-Experte von Exit-Deutschland, Dr. Bernd Wagner auch für falsch, aber: 
„Die meisten von ihnen sind in der Tat rechtsextrem und man kann nicht die Augen davor verschließen, dass auch Rechtsextremisten anderer politischer Parteien und Organisationen bei den sogenannten Reichbürgern mitwirken.“ © Sputnik/ Ramil Sitdickov Preußen statt Bund: „Reichsbürger“ bestellt sich Kalaschnikow Vorfälle mit den sogenannten Reichsbürgern gibt es bereits seit Jahren immer wieder. Nichtige Anlässe wie etwa eine KFZ-Kontrolle oder die Identitätsfeststellung würden mit dem Verweis auf Nichtzuständigkeit abgelehnt. Da könne sich dann solch eine Auseinandersetzung hochschaukeln, bei der die Polizei gezwungen sei, teilweise mit körperlicher Gewalt zu reagieren, beklagt der Landesvorsitzende der GdP in Sachsen-Anhalt, Uwe Petermann, gegenüber Sputnik.
Um die Bildung einer Parallelgesellschaft zu verhindern und um den Schutz der Beamten und der Bevölkerung zu garantieren, müsse hier alles getan werden, um das staatliche Gewaltmonopol zu behalten, betont er. So müsse man Verstöße sofort ahnden, denn der Ansatz durch die Negierung der Bundesrepublik sei verfassungswidrig, erklärt der Gewerkschaftler: 
“Aber ob nun diese Menschen die verfassungsgemäße Ordnung stürzen wollen, ist eine andere Frage. Sie versuchen sich intelligent zu verhalten und solche Dinge zu verschleiern. Somit müssen diese Personen durch den Verfassungsschutz beobachtet werden, um auch möglicherweise ein verfassungsfeindliches Vorgehen zu erkennen und dementsprechend durch den Staat reagieren zu können. Die Reichbürger sind kein geschlossener Verein, wie z.B. die NPD. Somit gibt es keine geschlossene Organisation, die man verbieten könnte. Man muss immer gegen einen einzelnen Reichbürger verfahren und sehen, wo dieser Gesetze verletzt hat. Das ist auch die Schwierigkeit, die der Staat derzeit hat."" 
Auch der Experte von Exit-Deutschland sieht es ähnlich: “Man kann in der Bundesrepublik, da es ein demokratischer Rechtsstaat ist, alle möglichen extremistischen Positionen vertreten. Mit der Tötung des Polizisten in Bayern ist aber nun ein Präzedenzfall geschaffen, der auf eine gesteigerte Aggressivität der Personenkreise hinweist. Und da wird das Thema Verbot verschiedener Strömungen insofern, dass sie sich organisatorisch gebunden zeigen, durchaus gestellt.” 
Vermehrt wurden zugleich in Bayern, Sachsen-Anhalt und Berlin Fälle bekannt, bei denen sich auch Beamte zu sogenannten Reichsbürgern bekannt haben. Die Behörden haben reagiert. Es wurden Disziplinarverfahren eingeleitet und zum Teil auch Beamte vom Dienst suspendiert. © AFP 2016/ DANIEL ROLAND „Reichsbürger“ in Georgensgmünd : Polizist erliegt Schussverletzungen 
Von einem Trend könne man hier noch nicht reden, betont der Pressesprecher der GdP-Berlin, Benjamin Jendro, in einem Telefongespräch mit Sputnik. Doch es ist schon auffällig, dass allein in den letzten Wochen den Berichten zu Folge mindestens acht solcher Fälle bekannt wurden. Sind etwa Staatsbedienstete eher für Reichs-Ideologien anfällig? 
Der Kriminologe und Rechtsextremismus-Experte Wagner kennt die Psychologie der Polizisten und erklärt dieses Phänomen folgendermaßen: 
„Beamte sehen in einer relativ liberalen Rechtsordnung ein großes Problem. Es stört sie, wenn Gesetzte nicht eingehalten werden. Wenn auch eigene Staatskollegen recht freischaffend manches Gesetz interpretieren. Diese wünschen sich mehr Kohärenz und mehr Stärke des Rechts. Wenn nun die Rechtsordnung nicht eingehalten wird, ist es für diese Personen, auch in Verbindung mit manchen Diensterlebnissen, sehr schmerzhaft. Dafür gibt es Erklärungen. Und Reichsbürger geben eben einfache Erklärungen. Das öffnet den Kopf für alternative Ideen. “ © Fotolia/ bilderstoeckchen ""Reichsbürger"" empfing Polizei mit Waffe und Schutzweste - Pressekonferenz in Bayern Bernd Wagner hat viele Erfahrungen mit Aussteigern aus der Reichsbürgerszene und Organisationen, wie dem Freistaat-Preußen, Königreich-Deutschland oder den Selbstverwaltern. Auch einen ehemaligen Postminister der brandenburgischen Reichsregierung hatte der Gründer von Exit-Deutschland beraten. 
Immer wieder bedauern ehemalige Aktivisten ihre verlorene Zeit in solchen Organisationen, stellt der Experte dabei fest. Man solle sich doch lieber den kritischen Fragen aus der Gegenwartshaltung nähern, gesellschaftliche Kritik im Rahmen einer bestehenden Rechtsordnung anbringen und sich politisch engagieren, meint er. Man dürfte allerdings stark annehmen, dass das Problem der der ansteigenden Militanz seitens dieser Gruppierungen nicht allzu bald und auch nicht von selbst wieder verschwinden wird. ...",german,2016-10-27T01:22:09.371+03:00,sputniknews.com,RU,1616,„Reichsbürger“ schlagen zu – Sind Beamte für Reichs-Idee besonders anfällig?,0,https://cdnde2.img.sputniknews.com/images/31311/86/313118615.jpg,0,0,281,10,281,bs

Co-présidente de l’ancien parti BDP ( qui deviendra par la suite le HDP ), elle est aujourd’hui la présidente de tous les maires des villes du Sud-Est de la Turquie, qu’elle représente auprès dans les discussions auprès des instances officielles.Gültan Lisanak avait déjà été arrêtée lors du coup d’état militaire de 1980, et torturée pour avoir refusé de renoncer à son identité kurde.« Chaque jour était un combat pour survivre », a-t-elle expliqué au site de presse Al Monitor, pour décrire ses conditions de survie dans l’ancienne prison de Diyarbakir, qu’elle décrit comme un « enfer » où « les abus avaient pris des proportions barbares. »Gültan Kisanak a déjà passé en tout quatre années et demi de sa vie en prison.En l’interpellant hier, c’est donc à une figure politique majeure de la Turquie et du peuple kurde que s’en prend le gouvernement d’Erdogan.

The Globalization of Rage Why Today’s Extremism Looks Familiar … Militant secessions from a civilization premised on gradual progress under liberal democratic trustees—the kind of civilization that D’Annunzio and his peers denounced as feeble and corrupt—are once again brewing within the West and far beyond it: and as before, they are fueled by a broad, deep, and volatile desire for destruction. –Foreign Affairs 
This is the single most important article we’ve read in Foreign Affairs in years. It grows out of the “populism versus globalism” meme we’ve been tracking regularly. 
We believed from the beginning that this meme would prove extremely important. The idea was that populism would be contrasted unfavorably to globalism and that this would be developed via directed history. 
We tend to think Brexit is an example of this. It still doesn’t make sense that Brexit passed when British electoral facilities are controlled by globalist elites. In other words, Brexit’s passage may have been purposeful. 
The idea, for instance, would be to ensure that Brexit has a broad array of negative consequences for the British. Paint Brexit as “populist” and then paint its negative consequences as occurring because the wise precepts of globalism were not adhered to. 
This is how elite propaganda works. Create a dialogue and then enforce it with the economic, legislative and military consequences – all of which are controlled by the dialogue-makers. 
Global warming doesn’t exist, or not in fashion represented in the popular media. But global warming has been acted upon economically and legislatively throughout the world. 
Likewise, “populism versus globalism” is a meme – a rhetorical construct – not a reality. 
But there can be little doubt now that those behind the meme intend to make real. We can see the rhetoric heightening. 
The consequences of a “populist” Brexit are going to be determinedly negative. If the “populist” Trump is elected in the US, the consequences will likely be similarly disastrous – and blamed on his populism. 
Foreign Affairs is the magazine of the Council on Foreign Relations, which is the elite sister of the elite-controlled British Roundtable. Foreign Affairs magazine enunciates elite banking policies. 
In this case, we would do well to pay heed to an emergent meme that will define the next decades. 
It is not enough to suggest globalist remedies. An entire argument must be constructed around globalism if it is to be fully implemented. 
And since the preferred device is Hegelian – thesis and antithesis giving way to synthesis – one needs to establish two sides. Globalism is the thesis here. Populism the antithesis. The synthesis will be a more fully emergent globalism. 
In the highly charged rhetoric of this Foreign Affairs article, we can see just how vehemently this emergent meme is being pursued. 
In reality, today’s malignancies are rooted in distinctly modern reactions to the profound social and economic shifts of recent decades, which have been obscured by the optimistic visions of globalization that took hold in the aftermath of the Cold War. 
Notice the language. Globalism is optimistic. Its alternative (populism) is “malignant. 
Then there is this: 
Behind all these developments lies the fact that globalization—characterized by the mobility of people, capital, and ideas and accelerated by the rapid development of communications and information technology—has weakened traditional forms of authority everywhere, from Europe’s social democracies to the despotic states of the Arab world. 
It has also produced an array of unpredictable new international actors that have seized on the sense of alienation and dashed expectations that defines the political mood in many places. 
The extremists of ISIS have exploited these changes with devious skill, partly by turning the Internet into a devastatingly effective propaganda tool for global jihad. 
You see? It is not enough to characterize populism as malignant. It must be conflated directly with ISIS. Trump, for instance, is not merely misguided. He is part of a larger terrorism. 
And populism is to be conflated with “conspiracy theory” as well … actually a CIA-developed meme. In fact, populism – so the article informs us – is responsible for “lynch mobs and mass shooters.” 
Populist and extremist attacks on reasoned debate and evidence-based analysis have made it easier for conspiracy theories and downright lies to spread and gain broad credence. Lynch mobs and mass shooters thrive in a climate where many people think of others only in terms of friends and foes and where sectarian loyalty or nativist hatred override civic bonds. 
The article goes on to blame some of today’s disturbing violence and aimlessness on major media. 
Of course, the article doesn’t tell us that most major media is controlled by a handful of individuals who run them to benefit the goals of the globalist elite. 
Here’s the duplicitous characterization: 
The world seems beset by pervasive panic, which doesn’t quite resemble the centralized fear that emanates from despotic power. Rather, people everywhere find themselves in thrall to the sentiment—generated by the news media and amplified by social media—that anything can happen, anywhere, to anybody, at any time. 
The pervasive panic the article discerns is further complicated by the continued failure of globalism, which is disordering people “spiritually.” 
In places where globalized capitalism has not fulfilled its promise of opportunity and prosperity, culturally and spiritually disorientated people have become increasingly susceptible to demagoguery and extremism. 
The consequences of globalism, should it continue to fail, will include the disenfranchising of the world’s youth. 
The inheritance of modern youth will include “racist nationalism” that will remove or reduce “freedom and prosperity.” 
The sudden and rapid success of racist nationalists and cultural supremacists ought to make liberals wonder whether the millions of young people awakening around the world to their inheritance—which for even the richest among them includes global warming—will be able to realize the modern promise of freedom and prosperity, or if they are doomed to hurtle, like many Europeans in the past, between a sense of inadequacy and fantasies of revenge. 
Generally speaking, populism is to be feared as the worst of all results, should it grip the world more pervasively in its icy clutches. 
Militant secessions from a civilization premised on gradual progress under liberal democratic trustees … are once again brewing within the West and far beyond it: and as before, they are fueled by a broad, deep, and volatile desire for destruction. 
This is a broad and ringing affirmation of globalism, which as we recently pointed out, is at root a religion. 
It is an evil religion however, proposing the gathering together of the world’s population under a single ruler (or group or rulers) who will have near-absolute control over the world’s billions. 
All the negatives attributed to populism in this article are actually properties of globalism. But the rhetoric justifies the ascension of globalism and the removal of populism. 
Conclusion: Populism is painted as malignant, exploitative, racist and violent. These are not opinions either. This article is proposing a broad gamut of properties that the wise solons of globalism will have to act against and eventually remove.

Editor of Austria’s Largest Paper Charged with ‘Hate Speech’ over Migrant Article … An editor of Austria’s largest paper, Kronen Zeitung, is to be tried for hate speech over a commentary he wrote about the migrant crisis last year. –Breitbart News 
This is part of a larger attack on the Western media, especially the alternative media. 
It’s surely not a coincidence that these attacks are being launched in several countries. The attack are being coordinated in our view by the same groups involved in the expanding scourge of globalization. 
More: 
On 25 October 2015, Christoph Biro wrote of the masses of migrants who were travelling through the Syrian countryside and remarked on the assaults and property damage committed by migrants, reports Kurier. 
Calling the majority of the migrants “testosterone-driven Syrians”, Mr. Biro recounted the multiple reports of migrants carrying out, in his words, “extremely aggressive sexual assaults”. 
He also detailed Afghan men had slashed the seats of the trains that were transporting them to Germany because they refused to sit where Christians had previously sat. 
Biro did not perform the acts but merely reported on them and drew a conclusion. But nonetheless he may go to jail. 
His case is not isolated but part of a trend. It is one that has reached the US, where Hillary Clinton has hinted at the adoption of similar approaches should she become president. 
In fact, both Clinton and President Barack Obama have suggested that those who are involved in “hate speech” via media presentations ought to suffer “consequences.” 
The argument is that such writing disturbs civil society and encourages violence. But this is wrongheaded. People should be prosecuted for actual violence – for deeds not words. 
ZeroHedge reports: 
A couple of days ago we noted that protests in North Dakota, over the Dakota Access Pipeline, were growing increasingly hostile with police arresting over 125 people just last weekend alone. 
Another startling discovery from the weekend was reports of police efforts to shoot down multiple media drones which some thought indicated an increasing hostility toward press seeking to cover the protests. 
Certainly, Deia Schlosberg, a documentarian who was recently charged with three felonies for filming activists shutting off oil pipelines, would tend to agree. 
The point here is that Schlosberg is not being prosecuted for deeds, only for her coverage. 
This is part of a larger effort to conflate reporting with “doing” – and marks a virtual revolution in the way journalism is conducted. 
In the future, if this tact is pursued, it will be government and law enforcement that can decide what’s going to be covered, depending on the interpretation of the coverage. 
Conclusion: If the reporting is seen as “inciting” violence or disturbance of civil society, the reporter can face legal consequences as grave or graver than the individuals actually performing the actions. This amounts to virulent censorship.",english,2016-10-26T22:11:16.583+03:00,thedailybell.com,US,,Hate Speech as a Weapon: Reporters Are Charged for Covering Disturbances,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

William Binney, the architect of the NSA’s surveillance program, resigned on October 31, 2001, after working for the agency for more than 30 years. He thinks that an intelligence worker may have hacked into the DNC emails due to concern about Hillary Clinton’s disregard of national security in her use of a personal email server and her continued lies about her activity. Once accessed, there’s no telling where the information could have gone.
The “Putin did it” story is a fable used to sway voters towards Clinton’s war-driven agenda.

On a talk radio show, he mentioned that there are numerous questions that are not being answered about the hacked DNC emails and the network log available to the NSA.
Binney explains that there was no evidence tying the alleged Russian hacks to Wikileaks, and he says that they would have access to this information through the network logs. “So, if the FBI really wanted them, they can go into that database and get them right now,” he said.
He finds their reluctance to speak to this matter highly suspicious. Delivered by The Daily Sheeple

Establishment figures on the left and right, such as Marco Rubio , are beginning to publicly fret about Wikileaks and what it could do to them. For now, the attention is on Hillary Clinton, whose corruption and true positions have been exposed on a number of issues .
Clinton’s long career in the highest levels of government has given Wikileaks plenty of material to publish, while Donald Trump’s character as an arrogant woman-groper is being revealed from his time in the entertainment business.
Julian Assange said he does have some information about Trump, but there is a strange reality there:
“I mean, it’s from a point of view of an investigative journalist organization like WikiLeaks, the problem with the Trump campaign is it’s actually hard for us to publish much more controversial material than what comes out of Donald Trump’s mouth every second day,” Assange said.
The horrible prospect of Trump or Clinton – both highly disliked by the populace – becoming president is the result of a system that is indeed rigged into a two-party dictatorship with the illusion of choice. Ben Swann explains some of it here .
One of the more worrying revelations – or should we say, “confirmations” – from the Podesta Emails is Clinton’s allegiance to the Israeli lobby . Her top foreign policy aide reminded her not to say anything publicly to offend “Bibi,” and she wrote a letter against the BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) against Israel on behalf of her mega-donor, Haim Saban.
This allegiance to the Israeli lobby means that Clinton’s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will largely echo that of Israel’s government, including its settlements on Palestinian lands and its treatment of Gaza as a giant prison camp.
For decades, various presidents have claimed to be working on “peace accords” with the Israelis and Palestinians, while the U.S. military-industrial complex reaps billions from Israel’s militarism and use of U.S.-made weapons in repeated Gaza massacres.
Why wage peace when war is so profitable, in the monetary sense and in the enablement of absolute State power?
In one email, we see the kind of deceit presidents will engage in to maintain the narrative of “pursuing peace.”
From MondoWeiss :
“ Here’s the context. In a March 2015 email, right after Netanyahu’s victory in the Israeli election, Clinton foreign policy aide Jake Sullivan passed along a Times article in which Netanyahu offered a mild apology for his racist election-eve warning to Jewish voters that Palestinians were coming out to the polls “in droves,” and in which he flipflopped on his promise that no Palestinian state would be established on his watch. Per the Times: 
The two-state solution “remains our goal today, because it is the only way to secure Israel’s future as a Jewish and democratic state,” [Netanyahu] added. 
Sullivan comments [from hacked Podesta emails]: 
Unsurprisingly, Pragmatic Bibi makes an appearance. 
Clinton steps right in: This is an opening that should be exploited. A Potemkin process is better than nothing. ” For those who many not be familiar with the word, “Potemkin” or Potemkin village means constructing something to deceive others into thinking a situation is better than it really is. Merriam-Webster says, “especially one presented for the purpose or propaganda.”
As Weiss points out, we’ve had a Potemkin process for 20 years already, so Clinton would merely continue using events to perpetuate the false hope of a “peace accord.”
Michael Omer-Man, former news desk manager for the Jerusalem Post, had strong words for Clinton :
“It’s hard to imagine a more troubling statement about Israel/Palestine from a politician who will in all likelihood be the next president of the United States, even if it represents only part of her thinking on the region…
when American politicians like Hillary Clinton say that the façade of a peace process is better than no process, they mean it is better for the United States and Israel, not for Palestinians. A Potemkin peace process expressly means maintaining the status quo of occupation and oppression while neutralizing any consequences Israel might face for its actions.”
For establishment figures like Hillary Clinton, the illusion of a peace process is more important than actually pursuing peace. Maintaining the narrative while profiting from conflict is the modus operandi of the two-party dictatorship.

… but America’s largest foreign creditor, China, sold a record $34 billion in US paper in the latest month, and bringing its total holdings to the lowest since 2012.

This led to an obvious question: is China dumping all of its foreign reserve holdings proportionately, or is Beijing strategically offloading its US paper, for financial, political reasons or otherwise, as it buys other foreign government bonds. The answer, at least according to the Nikkei, is the latter.
As the Japanese owner of the Financial Times reports , China is on a shopping spree, and has been “gobbling” up Japanese government bonds, adding that Beijing bought close to a net 9 trillion yen ($86.6 billion) worth of JGBs in the January-August period, more than tripling the amount from the same period last year. Incidentally that’s almost equivalent to the number of US Treasurys sold by China.
A simple explanation for the shift is that the People’s Bank of China has been reducing its holdings of U.S. Treasurys in anticipation of higher U.S. interest rates and shifting some of its money to JGBs, where higher rates – courtesy of 250% in debt/GDP – are largely guaranteed to never arrive.
But more importantly, and this could explain the perplexing recent strength in the Yuan, this trend may be a reason behind the yen’s appreciation in foreign exchange markets in recent months .
According to Japan’s Ministry of Finance, China invested 8.9 trillion yen in Japanese securities in net terms between January and August. Buying started to exceed selling more often on a monthly basis in the second half of 2015. In April, net buying surpassed 3 trillion yen. Curiously, China is not buying the Japanese bonds for the “yield”, but rather for liquidity: most of the securities purchased by the PBOC are bonds with maturities of one year or less.
Judging by the latest TIC data, China’s selling of US paper is accelerating, which also suggests that just as China has been a factor pushing the Yuan higher, the dollar has been pressured lower by the ongoing Chinese liquidation. One wonders how much higher the USD will jump if and when China decides to halt its selling of US paper, and how much lower the Yuan will then tumble in response, leading to even faster capital outflows from China.

Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank stock was shaken following a Bloomberg report that Deutsche Bank’s hedge fund clients had withdrawn billions in margin cash from the bank’s prime brokerage unit, adding a shade of liquidity concerns to the bank’s ongoing capitalization woes. It now appears that DB has continued to hemmorhage cash with the FT reporting that the German lender’s exchange traded fund unit has seen billions in outflows as Germany’s biggest lender considers whether to sell parts of its asset management business.
Investors have pulled $8bn from Deutsche’s ETF arm so far this year . This is an unwelcome collapse after a strong performance in 2015 when the unit attracted positive inflows of $28bn, according to ETFGI, a London-based consultancy. DB’s clients have been heading for the exit after the bank was threatened with a $14bn claim by the DOJ.
“The noise around Deutsche Bank has clearly not helped its ETF business,” said a senior executive from a rival asset manager who did not wish to be named.
As the FT adds, Deutsche has put aside €5.5bn to cover potential litigation costs but the threat of a larger bill has forced it to consider selling a minority stake in its asset management arm, its best-performing division in recent years. However, efforts to raise fresh capital could be hindered by the outflows from the ETF unit, which is widely regarded as one of the crown jewels of Deutsche’s asset management operations.
To be sure, DB defended itself when a spokesman for the bank said the ETF outflows were “part of the broader industry-wide” trend away from currency-hedged ETFs. The outflows account for 10 per cent of Deutsche’s total ETF assets under management, and indeed the difficulties at Deutsche coincide with a period of upheaval across the European ETF industry. A cut-throat price war led by BlackRock and Vanguard, the world’s two largest fund managers, has forced rivals to abandon their strategic plans.
Still, the cash strapped bank may find it more complicated to unwind positions and provide the needed cash at a time when each of its moves is scrutinized under a microscope.
DB is not alone: Source, the London-based ETF provider, has been put up for sale fewer than three years after being acquired by Warburg Pincus, the private equity group. Commerzbank, Germany’s second-largest lender, has also confirmed it plans to spin off its ETF business into a separate unit.
Some industry observers believe Deutsche’s ETF business could make an attractive acquisition target for a rival looking to establish a foothold in the market. A former Deutsche employee said that efforts had been made in the past to find a buyer for the ETF unit, which has assets of $76.9bn and ranks as the fifth-largest ETF provider globally.
“We heard a lot of rumours that senior management put [the ETF business]up for sale several times but they were unable to get much traction for the price they were asking,” he said.
It wouldn’t be the first time Deutsche has tried to monetize some of its better performing assets. Following a review in 2011, the Frankfurt-based lender tried to sell large chunks of the asset management business but a potential deal with Guggenheim Partners, the US investment firm, fell apart in 2012. The bank subsequently merged the asset management division with the bank’s wealth unit, bringing the two together under the leadership of the scandal-plagued Michele Faissola whose involvmenet in a series of Monte Paschi deals has prompted the Italian government to launch an investigation into his “market manipulation” activities. As reported previously, the former investment banker is one of four executives to have led the asset management division in as many years.

Think paradigm shift of the most disruptive type while power shifts eastward. By Jim Willie
The Western central bank franchise system is totally broken, totally insolvent, and totally corrupt. It invites the Gold Standard return. The entire financial system is built upon a debt-based monetary system. The debt saturation process has run its full course. The central bank heads have been covering the sovereign debt for the last five years, having rendered their balance sheets as ruined.
Debt is at obscene levels, like $19.7 trillion for the USGovt. No debt limits are in place anymore, a signal that most likely it has already defaulted. A hidden game is underway, with control lost to the creditors, even as they attempt to salvage their debt holdings. The major central banks continue to manage badly the great game, where money is fake phony and a farce.
A titanic battle is underway, where the Eastern nations are discarding their USTreasury Bonds, and doing so in tremendous volume while they set up the many platforms and pieces to the Gold Standard. 
The US Federal Reserve monetary policy of hyper-inflation has failed to revive the USEconomy, failed to legitimize the debt securities, failed to halt the financial corruption, and failed to stem capital destruction. The official monetary policy has only succeeded in preventing the failures of almost all big Western banks.
They are all insolvent, mostly supported by narco money laundering in the hundreds of $billions. The Eastern super-powers are leading a campaign to put aside the US$-based financial system, isolate it to the sidelines, while arranging a new system. The Gold-based system will be complete with its currency, sovereign debt securities, transfer systems, global offices, and debt rating agencies, maybe even debit cards. The East strives to install the Gold Standard as the remedy to the ongoing global financial crisis. The West has made exactly no movement toward solution, remedy, or enforcement against bond.
Four graphs display the broken unfixable bizarre situation: Graph 1 – BALANCE SHEET DESTRUCTION Central bank balance sheets could take decades to normalize, so the conventional thinking goes. Their balance sheets will never return to normal. Most assets of toxic paper are far more worthless than junk bonds. A normalization process would require at least 50 years of more financial repression and deep corruption.
A massive global debt write-down of sovereign bond is coming, on the back end of the Global Financial RESET. Think paradigm shift of the most disruptive type while power shifts eastward. The risk of war rises. 

The big Western banks find themselves in an impossible Catch-22 situation. The markets are addicted to QE and its destructive money hyper inflation. Federal Reserve policymakers have acknowledged that their $4 trillion balance sheet will not shrink any time soon. Also, Bank of England officials talk of crisis fighting tools as semi-permanent fixtures. In Asia, the Bank of Japan has developed a new monetary policy framework that features admitted infinite QE. The financial crisis the balance sheet volume to GDP ratios for the Bank of England and USFed have peaked at around 25%, the highest level ever recorded. Uncharted territory has been entered.
The USFed balance sheet ratio to GDP previously reached 23% in 1940 during World War II. The Bank of England ratio approached 20% in the 1730s during the South Sea Bubble scheme, 1816/17 during the Great Re-coinage, the 1830s/1840s following other wars, and in the immediate aftermath of WW2. In every scenario above, the central banks managed to unwind their balance sheets. But then the great unwinding took decades, up to 60 years in some cases. This time is different. No economic growth is anywhere remotely on the current horizon, nothing sufficient to unwind the tremendous debt burden.
This is where the conventional analyst turns stupid, even locked in fantasy. They assume the GDP growth has been around 3% in recent years, when it has been closer to minus 4% or minus 5% each year since 2008 in a fierce recession with strong feedback loops. We are not on the verge of economic expansion, which can relieve the balance sheet toxicity, but rather a financial reform to sweep away the USDollar and to render its USTreasury Bonds as near worthless paper. The next chapter will be centered upon the Gold Standard, first in trade payment, next in bank reserves, finally in currencies. 
The installation of the Gold Standard will render almost all US$-based debt securities as toxic paper, much like African Govt Bonds. QE might have bought time for the big US banks, but it guaranteed the kill of the USEconomy as host, and the default of the USGovt debt. No semblance of return to normalcy can come. This is why war is being vigorously pursued, to retain power.
Graph 2 – CONCENTRATION OF CENTRAL BANK ASSETS Big Central Bank assets have jumped the fastest in five years to $21 trillion. The toxic sovereign bond bubble is the largest bubble in history. Four major central banks control 75% of all central bank assets. Any currency reform must come from a major nation and its lead. The majority of the world’s central bank assets are controlled by four sites: China, the United States, Japan, and the European Union. The next six each account for an average of 2.5%, namely the central banks of Brazil, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, India, and Russia. The major nations control toxic vats of deeply impaired debt paper which nobody wants.

The big four central banks are often called the major central banks. They are from the so-called industrialized nations, when in fact they are from former industrial states with a strong leaning toward New Third World status. They control the global financial structure and rig markets in order to keep it stable. If any changes are to come to the USDollar and the King Dollar reign of terror, the reform will be done by a major central banks with support from an alliance of other nations. Do not expect reform. Instead expect a revolution from the East, as it installs the Gold Standard in certain key spots. The best one can expect is a dual financial universe, where the USDollar is gradually phased out.
Graph 3 – Dumping of USTreasury Bonds in Worldwide Trend A truly massive international dumping of USDollars has entered a second powerful phase. The Saudis and China recently dumped huge blocks of USTreasury Bonds. Foreign central banks liquidated a record $346 billion in USGovt debt securities in the last 12 months, the trend having accelerated. Numerous factors contribute to the dumping, which manifests the fading global confidence in the USDollar. Amplified Quantitative Easing (QE) volume soaks up the large volumes dumped on the bond market, further eroding the faith in fiat currency.
One month ago, a troublesome sharp decline was seen in the USTreasurys held in custody, which is the formal way to describe central bank holdings kept at the USFed computer banks. The amount fell by over $27.5 billion in a single week, the biggest weekly drop since January 2015. One month later the trend continues with powerful force, enough to capture global attention. The custody volume fell sharply again by another $22.3 billion in the past week, pushing the total amount to $2.805 trillion, another fresh post-2012 low. 
The foreign central banks have continued their relentless liquidation of US debt securities held in the USFed’s official custody account. History is being made, as global sentiment and conditions are changing in fierce mode. The King Dollar throne is having its legs removed, kicked out, and cut off. Most financial analysts refuse to put the factors in such stark terms, but the Jackass does so naturally and without hesitation. Three dynamics can be identified as the principal proximal factors, detailed in the Hat Trick Letter for the October edition in the reports.

A month ago was observed a massive $343 billion in USTreasury sales by foreign central banks in the period July 1st 2015 to July 1st 2016, something truly unprecedented in size. Fast forward to the latest monthly update, which was posted as July data. All have gone worse. The running latest 12 months (LTM) in foreign central bank sales shot up to a new all time high $346.4 billion. Thus over one third of a $trillion in USTreasurys were sold in the past 12 months. Recall that in three months late in 2015, the Chinese sold $250 billion in USTBonds, which forced the IMF inclusion of the RMB into their formal basket of currencies. The dumping has been global, massive, and without precedent. China is the major seller, while the Saudis are the newest sellers. The broken Outhouse of Saud requires the funds to offset the collapse of the Petro-Dollar, and to backstop the country’s soaring budget deficit made worse by the obscene Yemen War.
The official story is told that private investors, both foreign and domestic, are soaking up hundreds of $billions in central bank holdings being sold on the bond market. The other dubious story is that bond yields are rising slightly, given the newfound concerns the USFed, the Bank of Japan, and maybe even the EuroCB will soon taper their purchases.
The bigger factor (surely not private investors) is the USFed ramping up hidden QE volume in a huge way, buying the massive bond dumpings, all kept secret and quiet so as not to disturb the pristine AAA rating of the USTBond toxic paper. Expect continued debt monetization of theUSGovt deficit, of which perhaps 75% is supported by the African style printing press. The USEconomy cannot grow its way out of the debt. They will monetize it until it default on the global stage.
The QE process cannot take in all the dumped USTBonds without psychological damage. The USDollar confidence is eroding globally. Faith in the USDollar is eroding very quickly. The nation is moving along in the US isolation process, identified as rogue nation on the financial front, terrorism front, laced vaccine front, and war front. Just the Jackass opinion.
Graph 4 – Evidence of USTBond Bubble (versus Diamonds) The USTreasury Bond bubble is the second biggest asset bubble is history, behind the residential real estate bubble in the last decade. The USTBonds are a massive sanctioned Ponzi Scheme, signifying the default of the USGovt debt and failure of its sovereign bond. The Elite controllers talk of a flight to safe haven, when in reality it is a leap into a black hole and toxic vat. Motive is to keep USGovt borrowing costs to minimal levels while the debt soars toward the $20 trillion mark. The gigantic black hole attracts legitimate capital from around the world. All will be subject to heavy losses. The USTreasury Bond asset bubble is supported by three major forces: the USFed monetary hyper inflation , the Interest Rate Swap derivative contract , the bond carry trade managed by Wall Street banks . More details are provided in the Hat Trick Letter for October.

The relation between top tier assets should remain stable, such as diamonds, special gemstones, classic art works & sculptures, special jewelry items, icon properties, and more. However, the bond price for USGovt debt has gone haywire, rising far beyond anything reasonable. Check out an unusual chart above, for the bond value versus the standard benchmark diamond price. This is a clear visible nasty bond bubble, which will burst just like the US housing market bubble that nobody in the mainstream moronic arenas expected. The Jackass correctly forecasted the housing market bust one year before it occurred. No longer are diamonds a girl’s best friend. It is USTBonds.
GOLD TRADE NOTE INTRODUCTION The Gold Trade Notes for trade payment might be coming into view, initially with commodity transfers, later swap contracts, and finally gold-backed short-term notes which supplant the USTBill. One might think of used newspapers on the floor, or of the dodo bird.
The trade might be made in exchange for either goods delivered or USTBills held. Detect a growing connection to finished goods being withheld from delivery. This is probably another sign of refusal of USTBills as payment.
As footnote, be sure to know that the preliminary steps to the Global Currency RESET will not be laid out in full disclosure for public benefit. It represents a tremendous investment opportunity for the elite, which they never tend to share. 
In fact, the RESET might be well along before it is even recognized. End to EuroRaj main thoughts and open analysis, for which much gratitude is given. The Jackass believes a few critical elements to the RESET are in place. More details on DIP Financing feature is included in the September Hat Trick Letter report.
***A major hitch obstacle can be inferred. Payment in USD terms might be the clot in the artery. Demands might be for hard asset swaps, and the contract security from large scale commitment of commodities, facilities, and property. The swap trade is coming into view, a presage of the Gold Trade Note.*** 
The Jackass concludes the USD rejection could be lifting its head within a gathering storm, without clear identification. It is indeed difficult to identify all the elements when hidden deals at the highest level are underway, and friction is omnipresent. The Bobcat Corp rejection of USTBills at Pacific ports is a clear story. For every one story recounted, there are 10 to 20 not yet heard.
My firm belief is that in Asian banking systems, they do not want the USTBills anymore. The banks in Asia are trying to dump them in heavy volume, not accumulate more worthless toilet paper. Finally the sharp blowback from printing QE money has hit. The USFed monetary policy saves the big insolvent banks, but kills capital. The result has finally seen manifested in USD global rejection, or at least hints toward the same. Asian banks still hold vast sums of USTBonds. They are not going to announce the rejection, but instead fight behind the walls for better terms of payment, even as they pursue the Gold Trade Note for payment at ports. It is coming, like daybreak follows the long night.
NEW SCHEISS DOLLAR & GOLD TRADE STANDARD In time, expect an eventual refusal by Eastern producing nations to accept USTreasury Bills in payment for trade. The IMF reversal decision assures this USTBill blockade in time, and might accelerate the timetable. The United States Govt cannot continue on five glaring fronts of gross negligence and major violations. These violations have prompted the BRICS & Alliance nations to hasten their development of diverse non-USD platforms toward the goal of displacing the USDollar while at the same time take steps toward the return of the Gold Standard.
The New Scheiss Dollar will arrive in order to assure continued import supply to the USEconomy. It will be given a 30% devaluation out of the gate, then many more devaluations of similar variety. The New Dollar will fail all foreign and Eastern scrutiny. The USGovt will be forced to react to USTBill rejection at the ports. 
The US must accommodate with the New Scheiss Dollar in order to assure import supply, and to alleviate the many stalemates to come. The United States finds itself on the slippery slope that leads to the Third World, a Jackass forecast that has been presented since Lehman fell (better described as killed by JPM and GSax).
The only apparent alternative is for the United States Govt to lease a large amount of gold bullion (like 10,000 tons) from China in order to properly launch a gold-backed currency. Doing so would open the gates for a generation of commercial colonization, but actual progress in returning capitalism to the United States. The cost would be supply shortages to the USEconomy, a result of enormous export increases to China.
The colonization has already begun, with secret deals galore. It is very unclear what deals are being struck in order to arrange for the USGovt to have a proper gold reserve hoard, for backing a new legitimate USDollar. Meetings at very high level are in progress, with little if any popular representation, only elite members present. Failure to produce a legitimate bonafide gold-backed currency would mean the United States must proceed with the New Scheiss Dollar, an illegitimate fake phony farce of a currency. 
It would be subjected to a series of devaluations. The result would be heavy powerful painful price inflation from the import front. The effect would be to reverse a generation of exported inflation by the United States. The entire USEconomy would go into a downward spiral with higher prices, supply shortages, and social disorder. However, the rising prices would come from the currency crisis, and not so much from the hyper monetary inflation. That flood of $trillions has been effectively firewalled off.

I’m old enough to remember when a million was a lot, and in the past two decades we have blown right through talking of millions and billions and are now throwing around trillions like its nothing… By Tim Taschler
Much of this debt has been purchased by none other than the big central banks. Sunday, Bloomberg reported that central bank assets have grown at the fastest pace in five years, topping $21 trillion:

The world’s biggest central banks are bulking up their balance sheets this year at the fastest pace since 2011’s European debt crisis to boost lackluster economic recoveries with asset purchases that are supporting stock and bond prices. 
The 10 largest lenders now own assets totaling $21.4 trillion, a 10 percent increase from the end of last year, data collected by Bloomberg show. Their combined holdings grew by 3 percent or less in both 2015 and 2014. 

You might think that with all this zero-rate and negative-rate money sloshing around that liquidity in the markets would not be an issue. But take a look at what happened in the forex markets last week. The British Pound (GBP), which is a major currency and heavily traded, took a 6% dive in less than two minutes. For reference, anyone watching the forex markets knows that a 1-2% move in the currency world is considered a big move, and 6% in two minutes is certainly not expected in something as liquid as the Pound.

The explanations for this move range from the standard “fat thumb” (i.e. someone inadvertently typed some extra zeros onto a sell ticket and swamped the market) to the easy-to-blame algo computers. Regardless of the reason, if there was one other than someone simply dumping a large number of Pounds onto the market, this type of thing shouldn’t really happen with so much liquidity sloshing around. People are certainly becoming complacent with ‘flash’ crashes, as if they are a normal occurrence and nothing to pay any attention to. I disagree. I think it could be a ‘tell’ and something to keep an eye on.
Think about where we are since 2008. The Fed keeps yapping about raising rates and normalization (though they do little other than talk), which has resulted in bond prices lower and interest rates higher. This is going to put enormous pressure on banks, pension funds and anyone else with a large amount of Sovereign bonds. A bond trader friend of mine told me that seeing all these bonds trading above par (i.e. over their face value) is going to lead to a massive problem. If you pay $1,100 for a $1,000 bond, you are only going to get $1,000 at maturity. At some point there will be losses as these bonds are marked back to par ahead of maturity.
Maybe the central bankers will be able to print and talk their way through to some successful outcome without actually raising rates. Or maybe they can have rates rise without causing some major dislocation in more asset classes, whether it be bonds, stocks, forex or commodities. But then again, maybe they can’t and that is why so many large, successful investors such as Soros, Druckenmiller and Buffett are sitting with large allocations of cash. With moves like we had in the Pound last week, it seems that the end game might be drawing near, and people might just want to be a little careful in the construction of their portfolios.

It was recently announced that members of the California National Guard who were deployed overseas would have to pay back enlistment bonuses to the government. 
The troops were deployed nearly ten years ago, and the Pentagon offered bonuses to encourage enlistment. Average bonuses were around $15,000. However, it turns out that only certain enlisted soldiers in specific intelligence, civl affairs, and non-commissioned officer roles were eligible for these bonuses, according to CNN . 
The call-back from the Pentagon was going to set people back an extraordinary amount of money, dollars that these people had come to depend on. Because of the government’s mistakes, those who served in the military were going to be forced to give that money back. 
However, the Pentagon is issuing a reversal of that order. 
Fox News reported : 
BRUSSELS – U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter has ordered the Pentagon to stop seeking repayments of enlistment bonuses given to California National Guard members who served overseas. 
His decision comes in the wake of angry reaction from members of Congress who demanded he relieve the burden on the Guard members. And the White House said President Barack Obama has warned the Defense Department not to “nickel and dime” service members who were victims of fraud by overzealous recruiters. 
In a statement issued during a meeting of defense ministers in Brussels, Carter said effort to collect reimbursement should stop “as soon as is practical” and will continue until a process to help the troops deal with the problem is worked out. 
It is a good thing that those who received these bonuses are not being forced to give them back. Granting of enlistment bonuses to those who were not eligible is a bad mistake that is the fault of the government, not the soldiers being deployed. The soldiers and their families should not have to suffer hardship for mistakes made by top Pentagon officials. 
Unfortunately, this is just the latest in a long history of reckless handling of finances by the Pentagon. I recently reported on how the Pentagon cannot account for over $6.5 trillion in its budget. That’s trillion with a T. 
Yet where is the outrage? It’s almost non-existent. Maybe it’s because we don’t fathom how much a trillion really is. 
Nonetheless, the Pentagon needs to be reined in. Their pattern of reckless spending is not one that can be tolerated. (And, no, effectively punishing the troops for top officials’ mistakes is not an option).",english,2016-10-27T00:30:54.720+03:00,thefederalistpapers.org,US,8968,Pentagon Makes STUNNING Reversal On Enlistment Bonus Repayments,0,http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/breaking-1.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Newt Gingrich has accused Fox News’ Megyn Kelly of being “fascinated” by sex, and not caring at all about public policy in a shocking and startling interview. 
The former Speaker of the House said Kelly showed “bias” for mentioning the groping allegations against Donald Trump. 
Kelly responded by saying her fascination is not of “sex,” but of who was going to end up in the White House. Kelly has a history with Trump – getting into a shouting match with the Republican candidate over comments he made about women during a primary debate. 
What set Gingrich off was Kelly’s mention of the leaked “sex boasts” tapes, where Trump is heard to say he grabs women by the genitals. 
Gingrich attacked, saying the media was obsessed with spending time on the unsubstantiated allegations of sexual misconduct, which Trump has denied. “You are fascinated with sex and you don’t care about public policy,” he said. 
“I’m not fascinated by sex, but I’m fascinated about sexual predators,” Kelly said. 
The bias the media has against Trump – especially focusing on sex – is historic. 
“This is a scale of bias worthy of Pravda and Izvestia, ” Gingrich said.

But rise they do –over and over again. 
I’m speaking about the “NeverTrump” movement that tried desperately to get anyone besides Donald Trump at the top of the GOP ticket and failed. 
We last heard from them right before the GOP national convention, when they suggested the electors might commit what amounts to mutiny and vote for someone other than Trump as their nominee. 
Now that the election is just days away, they seem to have come up with one last ditch – and certifiably insane way to keep Donald J. Trump out of the Oval Office: 
Elect, then impeach. 
That’s their big plan. Elect Trump as president of the United States, then turn around and have him impeached, tried and booted from office, leaving us with a much more palatable Mike Pence as President. 
Our friends at The Federalist first floated this idea Tuesday and while they acknowledge it’s a near impossibility, it shows just how desperate they are to keep Mr. Trump from the White House. 
There is a way out of this mess. It is a desperate plan, but desperate times, desperate measures: Elect-and-Impeach. Elect the ticket. Impeach Trump. 
The Republican Party does have an attractive candidate on its ticket. Socially conservative. Economically conservative. Conservative on national defense. Morally and religiously impeccable. The trouble is, that man is the Republican candidate for vice president, Mike Pence. 
But if Trump were impeached immediately after he took office, the Republican candidate for vice president would become president in his place. Further, if Republicans take the lead in removing Trump from office, the party might regain some of its lost credibility in parts of the electorate that it is anxious to attract. 
Jonathan Asbach , who is a PhD student at the prestigious Hillsdale College, thinks that while this would be a difficult plan, it’s not impossible. The GOP is at odds with its own nominee. If enough of them are willing to cross party lines to vote for impeachment, it could be done. 
Then there’s the problem of what to charge Trump with. He must be guilty of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” according to the Constitution. Asbach argues that “if Trump is half as corrupt as we have been told, surely some charge could be made to stick—especially if the recent allegations of sexual assault prove to be more than empty propaganda.” 
Elect-and-Impeach offers conservatives precisely what they want: A solid conservative president far better than either of the two major-party candidates. He’s far better, for that matter, than either of the two leading third-party candidates who have attracted attention as magnets for protest votes. 
There are two steps for this to actually happen, he writes. First, the GOP would have to grow a spine. “Republican congressmen and senators must pledge to take on the unsavory job of impeaching their own candidate the moment he becomes president,” Asbach writes. “As this is by far the least-bad option that Republican leaders have, they should be willing to step up to the plate. 
Second, all the GOP voters who have abandoned the party because of Trump would have to return to the flock, actually vote for the candidate knowing that “it is not really him you are voting for, then… lobby your senator and congressman to do their part and remove Trump from the head of it.” 
There is a potential for dawn after the dark night of the 2016 electoral season. There is a very real possible future in which Pence is the president of the United States, in which the country is in safe, responsible, conservative hands. It would also be one in which the Supreme Court is saved from the lawless ruffians who want to rewrite the Constitution as they see fit. 
But for that future to be realized, Republicans have to work together, and they have to do so quickly. Inertia is our greatest obstacle. This has never been done before. That makes it seem like it cannot be done. But America cannot afford our complacency. This is our last chance to prevent impending electoral catastrophe. 
So this is a plea to conservative leaders and conservative voters: Do your part. Make the pledge. Cast the vote. Help make Elect-and-Impeach a reality. 
Just when I thought the #NeverTrumpers had quieted down, they come up with this plan. 
I have to hand it to them – it’s certainly different . 
It will never, ever, work. But it shows the complete desperation that some folks have about the prospect of Donald Trump as president of the United States.",english,2016-10-27T00:30:55.842+03:00,thefederalistpapers.org,US,8968,The #NeverTrump’s Final Plan: ‘Elect And Impeach’,0,http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/trumpBias.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Robert Gehl reports that the City of Portland has come up with a genius idea to get America’s schoolchildren back on track. 
With our nation’s educational system in shambles and our students doing worse and worse compared with other nations (worse than Slovakia? ), school officials have decided to ban homework. 
That’s the big plan from folks whose city has the most strip bars per capita and whose motto is: “Keep Portland Weird.” 
The plan – to ban all homework in elementary schools – went into effect with the start of school this week. 
Instead, OregonLive reports , here is what the school tells students to do with their free time: “Cuddle with your parents. Play board games with your siblings. Pick up a favorite book to read or be read to. Run around and be as active as you can.” 
Officials claim that giving young kids homework doesn’t help their test scores at all … 
Why ban homework? A team of teachers at Cherry Park Elementary in the David Douglas school district in East Portland dug into the research and found that, while high school students learn more when they do homework, for elementary pupils, there is little to no evidence homework does any good. 
But further down, we discover the true motive behind their homework ban: Racism . 
Principal Kate Barker says assigning regular homework isn’t a fabulous idea at any elementary school, but especially not at Cherry Park, where at least 75 percent of students live at or below the poverty line and families speak more than 30 different languages. 
“We find that homework really increases that inequity,” Barker said. “It provides a barrier to our students who need the most support.” 
That’s right. They’re not saying homework doesn’t help. What they’re saying – and trust me, I’m a teacher – is that homework doesn’t help poor people (they mean minorities) and that if it doesn’t help poor people, then nobody should do it. 
The truth is that lower-income families have less time to spend with their children – making sure they do their homework, helping them with it. So fewer of the lower-income, minority kids do it. 
So rather than find a way to get these parents to spend more time helping their kids, they’re giving up and just banning homework altogether. 
Barker says the school will carefully monitor if students are making enough academic progress and will tweak things if they are not. But making better use of the school day, not assigning homework, will be the strategy if change is needed, she said. 
Teachers got on board with the no-homework policy once the rationale was explained, Barker said. Parents have been 100 percent in favor of the change. 
And the students? They, she said, “are cheering.” 
And that’s why our school system is failing.

Robert Gehl reports that in a perfect sign of how little respect Barack Obama has for America’s men and women in uniform, he just offered our soldiers a pay raise that effectively leaves them with less money . 
Back in April, the House Armed Services Committee approved a 2.1 percent pay raise for all military personnel – just above the increased cost of living. 
But that was just too much for Barack Obama. He countered with a 1.6 percent pay raise, below even what it takes to cover the cost of living. 
This will be the fourth straight year that Obama’s pay raises for the military doesn’t even keep up with average wage growth in the private sector. @Militarydotcom the 1.6% raise subtract the BAH cuts and healthcare ""reform"" means military members & veterans will loose $ this year

This is all going on while the Obama Administration is spending untold millions bringing in improperly vetted Syrian refugees. @RMConservative @JBaker31826004 Obama spends $millions on admission of Syrian refugees & just cut the military pay raise from 2.1% to 1.6%.

When you add in rising health costs and the reduction in the housing allowance (BAH), it’s a pretty significant cut in pay. 
The Independent Journal Review interviewed several veterans who are on disability and asked them how such a meager pay raise affects them: 
Chris receives 70% disability resulting from internal injuries and traumatic brain injury (TBI). His raise at 1.6%? Just $27 per month: 
“The small increases [of living expenses] have affected our family of five. Not only do we have a cost increase of daily expenses and from adding a new baby, but living expenses have outpaced the raises dramatically. 
In the last year, our mortgage payment has gone up twice, totaling over $200 a month, just to keep up with our escrow. We are both working hard, more than we would like with three small kids, to survive and maintain our standard of living.” 
Zach’s disability rating is 50%: 
“A 1.6% increase would add $18.18 to my monthly award. So this year I could add less than a meal per month to the table. 
I try to maintain a humble heart and mind; remembering the fact that the money I receive is a gift from God. So I do what I am able to with the gift given. But my cost of living continues to increase so my ‘increase’ basically just reduces the actual ‘decrease’ in salary.” 
In addition to these cuts, the military is considering privatizing military commissaries, which most experts predict will result in higher food prices on base. 
This is a perfect example of what little regard Barack Obama has for America’s fighting forces.",english,2016-10-27T00:30:56.988+03:00,thefederalistpapers.org,US,8968,The DESPICABLE Treatment of Our Troops Summed Up By One Cartoon,0,http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/TroopHalloweenCrop.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

C.E. Dyer writes that the disaster that is Obamacare is about to get worse for many people enrolled in the health insurance marketplace. On Monday, the Obama administration confirmed that premiums will skyrocket for many people next year, according to the Associated Press . 
The AP reported: 
Before taxpayer-provided subsidies, premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market, according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services. Some states will see much bigger jumps, others less. 
Moreover, about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from, after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group, Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles. 
In some states, the premium increases are striking. In Arizona, unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27-year-old buying a benchmark “second-lowest cost silver plan” will jump by 116 percent, from $196 to $422, according to the administration report. 
But HHS said if that hypothetical consumer has a fairly modest income, making $25,000 a year, the subsidies would cover $280 of the new premium, and the consumer would pay $142. Caveat: if the consumer is making $30,000 or $40,000 his or her subsidy would be significantly lower. 
Larry Levitt, who follows the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, said of the increases: “Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating, and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period.” 
Donald Trump’s campaign spokesman, Jason Miller, said in a statement on Monday: “This shows why the entire program must be repealed and replaced.” Miller added, “While (Hillary) Clinton wants to expand the failed program known as Obamacare, Mr. Trump knows the only way to fix our nation’s failing health care system is complete and total reform.” 
Reports have warned that this was coming down the pike for some time; however, HHS’s confirmation ahead of open enrollment beginning Nov. 1 — one week before the election — is likely to cause major headaches for many people. 
This debacle is not unexpected either — it’s exactly what President Obama and Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton wanted to happen. 
Obamacare was never the end goal. Rather, it was a stepping stone toward single-payer, government-run healthcare. That is a big reason why Obama wants Clinton to become president — his legacy is at stake. 
Obama’s legacy is largely wrapped up in Obamacare and what it leads to. Clinton tried to push this first step during her time as first lady and failed, but the conditions will be ripe for her to go even further should she be elected. 
If Clinton becomes president, there’s no doubt that her next step will be to move to single-payer healthcare. Obamacare is bad, there’s no doubt about it, but single-payer government healthcare would be even worse.",english,2016-10-27T00:30:57.301+03:00,thefederalistpapers.org,US,8968,Hilarious Cartoon Reveals 2016 Political Version of The “Walking Dead”,0,http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ObamacareZombieCrop.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

C.E. Dyer reports that actor James Woods posted a powerful video on Twitter about what happened on Highway 265 in Arkansas over four decades ago that Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton doesn’t want people to know about. 
The video chronicled the rape of a 12-year-old Arkansas girl, Kathy Shelton, that occurred on May 10, 1975 when two men lured the girl into their car and brutally assaulted her. 
— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 20, 2016 
This video details the horrific attack…and the actions of the attorney who defended one of the rapists: Hillary Clinton. 
According to the video, child was raped and beaten so brutally that she spent five days in a coma and was left unable to bear children. 
A local paper mill worker, 41-year-old Thomas Alfred Taylor, was charged with the rape. Then Hillary Rodham became his attorney. 
Taylor had semen mixed with the 12-year-old victim’s blood in his underwear, proving that he committed the crime. In court, Hillary maligned the rape victim’s character in order to defend her monster of a client. 
From the video: “Taylor’s attorney went to extraordinary lengths to discredit the child victim, suppressing all oral, written and physical evidence, forcing the 12-year-old to submit to polygraphs and psychiatric evaluations, even accusing the child (who had been a virgin until the attack) of seeking out older men and ‘fantasizing’ her rape.” 
The victim has recently come forward to talk about how Hillary’s lies ruined her life, which after the trial spiraled into a struggle with drugs and prison time. 
Shelton, who has already been put through a truly horrific nightmare, had to hear the tapes released in which Hillary laughed about the trial. 
Hillary laughed, on tape, about a trial of a man who brutally raped a 12-year old girl and subsequently received less than a year in prison for his horrific crime. 
Shelton has decided to speak out about her nightmare at the hands of Hillary Rodham. The video ends with a message from Shelton to Clinton, “You lied about me. You took me through Hell.” 
Clinton has claimed that she had an obligation to defend Taylor, but she is wrong; she did not have to do what she did. What she put a 12-year-old rape victim through is beyond the pale. 
Liberals regularly talk about victim blaming and rape culture in America, but where is the outrage about what Clinton did to a 12-year-old rape victim as a defense attorney? 
What else is there to say really? If you can watch that video and not be utterly and completely disgusted with Clinton, well, God help you.",english,2016-10-27T06:49:56.362+03:00,thefederalistpapers.org,US,8968,Hillary's Hypocrisy On Sexual Assault BRUTALLY Exposed | The Federalist Papers,0.983,http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/hillary-believing-assault-allegations-8x4.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

And there’s no “lamer” duck than a president whose just days away from being replaced. 
Perhaps that’s the perfect opportunity for what’s really happening while nobody’s looking: 
A massive spike illegal immigrants streaming through the southern border – mainly in the border town of McAllen, Texas. They’re coming on a daily basis and being trucked to a migrant center at a Catholic Church. 
They’re fitted with ankle monitors and told to sit. Sit and wait while they file for asylum. 
Apparently, the illegals are being told that Hillary Clinton will win the election and that when she does, she will grant amnesty to illegals who are already here by the time she’s elected. So they’re flooding in for that reason. 
On the other hand, some illegals are being told that Donald Trump will win, build a massive border wall and once it’s up, nobody will ever get in again. So they’re flooding in for that reason as well. 
Some days, CBS Local reports , the McAllen stretch of the border sees 1,000 illegal crossers per day. 
“We’re getting mass spikes of people crossing and turning themselves in,” he said. 
Experts told CBS News the number of immigrants crossing the border won’t drop after Election Day. 
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has repeatedly said as president the U.S. will build a wall along the Mexico border to keep out immigrants trying to enter the country illegally. 
Earlier this month, Trump claimed the U.S. government is speeding up the citizenship process for immigrants on the waiting list so they can vote. 
“They’re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote,” Trump said during a meeting with the National Border Patrol Council. 
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to propose immigration legislation in her first 100 days as president that would include a route to citizenship. Her approach is largely in line with that approved by Democrats and Republicans in the Senate in 2013 but turned aside by the House. 
Trump has said that he opposes any pathway to legal status for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. They would have to return to their home countries and apply for legal entry should they wish to come back. 
He has not said what would happen to those who choose to stay, but said they are subject to deportation. Trump has also called for an end to “birthright citizenship,” currently granted to anyone born in the U.S. as per the 14 th Amendment.",english,2016-10-27T09:25:58.464+03:00,thefederalistpapers.org,US,8968,Migrants FLOOD Into U.S. From Mexico Right Before Election,0,http://thefederalistpapers.integratedmarket.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/illegalimmigration-1024x775-1.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Donald Trump has ended all campaigning and fundraising events meant to help the Republican party and their get-out-the-vote campaign in the final two weeks. 
Aides to the GOP candidate told Fox News that “Trump Victory,” the fundraising committee for the campaign and the party, held its last fundraiser on Oct. 19 – and that was the last one. 
The move cuts off a key financial source for Republican candidates hoping to retain control of both the House and the Senate, Fox News is reporting . 
“We’ve kind of wound down,” Trump’s finance chairman Steven Mnuchin said. “But the online fundraising continues to be strong.” 
By contrast, The Washington Post is reporting that the Clinton campaign has held no fewer than 41 fundraising events between now and election day . 
Mnuchin said that Trump was focusing on making a final pitch to voters at events and rallies rather than directly soliciting for money. 
“We have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],” Mnuchin said of the candidate. “Unlike Hillary, who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.” 
The Post reports the RNC has collected about $40 million from “Trump Victory” since Sept. 30. 
RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the organization “[continues] to fundraise for the entire GOP ticket.” 
Meanwhile, Politico reported Tuesday that the Senate Leadership Fund, a Super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was putting $25 million into seven Senate races deemed crucial in determining the balance of power on Capitol Hill. 
The Trump campaign has largely written off the GOP establishment for much support, and it appears this is a little bit of “payback.” Trump has said he doesn’t need the party to win, and if the polls are any indication, he might be right.

Standing Rock, ND — Dramatic video from Intercept reporter, Jihan Hafiz , was released this week from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests showing a full on assault by militarized police on peaceful people. The video is from Saturday but took several days to be released as cops confiscated the camera used to film it. 
The video was taken as water protectors and reporters covering the protests marched toward the construction site. However, their peaceful walk was swiftly interrupted by militarized shock troops armed with massive cans of pepper spray, batons, rubber bullets, and assault rifles. 
According to Hafiz, the march was undertaken in solidarity with several protesters who had chained themselves to bulldozers and pipeline machinery at the construction site. But the marchers never made it to their destination. Instead, they were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons. Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns, and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning. 
“Don’t move, everyone is under arrest,” a voice says from the military vehicle that appears to be equipped with a Long Range Acoustic Hailing Device, or LRAD. 
As protesters attempted to leave, the police surrounded them and began their attack. According to Hafiz, several women were targeted for leading the march and dragged from the crowd to be arrested. Police body slammed one man and another woman’s ankle was broken as she ran. 
The militarized police then circled the protesters in an apparent move to ‘kettle’ them — a tactic usually reserved for urban protests in which riot police force large crowds into corners to seemingly provoke them. However, the protesters stayed entirely peaceful. 
Police continued their mass arrests even though the people were trying to leave. Some natives were seen running for the hills as the assault began. 
One officer is seen in military camouflage with a ski mask and a tear gas grenade launcher — as if he were going to war. In total, reports Hafiz, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. It was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. A majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer. 
Among those arrested were journalists, a teen child who was also pregnant, and an elderly woman. 
They were all brought to the jail where protesters were forced to sit in the jail’s common area as police had no other place to put them. According to Hafiz, women were strip searched, protesters were refused phone calls, and no one received food or water. One woman even had her medication confiscated by police, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. 
When Hafiz was finally released, she attempted to get back her camera and was told that she could not have it back. “Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime,” they said. 
In the land of the free, filming cops assault peaceful men, women, and children is considered a ‘crime.’ 
Over the past several weeks, the police state has come out in full force as Native Americans fight to protect their water sources from the threat of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Mainstream media has remained largely silent as federal, state and local authorities worked on behalf of Energy Transfer Partners to squash dissent. 
Even prominent journalists, like Hafiz, have found themselves targets of the State, charged with dubious “crimes” such as “ inciting a riot ” and “ conspiracy to theft of services ” – for doing nothing more than filming protests and the ensuing violent crackdowns.

Moscow, Russia – With all eyes on Russia’s unveiling their latest nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which NATO has dubbed the “SATAN” missile , as tensions with the U.S. increase, Moscow’s most potent “weapon” may be something drastically different. 
The rapidly evolving geopolitical “weapon” brandished by Russia is an ever increasing stockpile of gold, as well as Russia’s native currency, the ruble. 
Take a look at the symbol below, as it could soon come to change the entire hierarchy of the international order – potentially ushering in a complete international paradigm shift – and much sooner than you might think. 
The symbol is the new designation of the Russian ruble, Russia’s national currency. 
Similar to how the U.S. uses the dollar sign ($), the U.K. uses the pound sign (£), and the European Union uses the euro symbol (€), Russia is about to begin exporting its symbol internationally. 
After the failed “reset” in U.S./Russian relations by the Obama administration, and the continued deterioration of the countries relationship, Washington began targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy, as well as specific individuals, meant to impose an economic burden so severe that it would force Moscow into compliance. 
Instead of decimating Russia, what it precipitated was a Russian response of gradually weaning themselves off of the hegemony of the U.S. petrodollar, and working with China to create an alternative to the SWIFT payment system that isn’t solely controlled by Western interests (see Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , New Development Bank). 
According to the Corbett Report : 
New reports indicate that China is ready to launch its SWIFT alternative, and for those who have their ear to the ground this is the most significant move yet in the unfolding process of de-dollarization that is seeing the BRICS-led “resistance bloc” breaking away from the financial stranglehold of the US-led “Washington Consensus.” 
For those who don’t know, SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication and is shorthand for the SWIFTNet Network that is used by over 10,500 financial institutions in 215 countries and territories to transmit financial transaction data around the world. SWIFT does not do any of the clearing or processing for these transactions itself, but instead sends the payment orders that are then settled by correspondent banks of the member institutions. Still, given the system’s near universality in the financial system, it means that virtually every international transaction between banking institutions goes through the SWIFT network. 
This is why de-listing from the SWIFT network remains one of the primary financial weapons wielded by the US and its allies in their increasingly important financial warfare campaigns. 
Recently, financial guru Jim Rickards, author of the book “Currency Wars,” wrote that “Russia is poised for a major comeback in its economy. Russian bonds and stocks and the Russian currency, the ruble, will all benefit.” Rickards believes a “strong turnaround” is coming within Russia, and that this comeback will benefit the ruble. 
While still suffering from the economic warfare being waged by the U.S., Russia has realized that as long they are subservient to the petrodollar, there remains a clear and present danger of the Russian economy being devastated by the whims of Washington. 
The Bank of Russia, that nation’s central bank, is extremely clear about its mission, and monetary policy declaring on its website: 
Monetary policy constitutes an integral part of the state policy and is aimed at enhancing well-being of Russian citizens. The Bank of Russia implements monetary policy in the framework of inflation-targeting regime, and sees price stability, albeit sustainably low inflation, as its priority. Given structural peculiarities of the Russian economy, the target is to reduce inflation to 4% by 2017 and maintain it within that range in the medium run. 
In layman’s terms, that means that monetary policy, similar to nuclear weapons and the military, are “an integral part of the state policy” in Russia. While many analysts have noted the increased build-up in Russia’s military arsenal, seemingly few have highlighted the massive build-up of Russian gold reserves over the past decade. 
Below is a chart showing Russian gold reserves between 1994 and last year, 2015: 
Since 2006, there has been a year-on-year increase that reveals a significant upward trend. The chart clearly reveals that Russia’s state policy of increasing state monetary assets, in the form of gold. Additionally, the Russian government has been converting state rubles into gold assets. From 2006 to 2015, Russia’s state holdings of gold tripled. 
Within just the past year Russia has substantially increased its gold holdings 
According to the Business Insider : 
In July of this year, the central bank of Russia added 200,000 ounces of gold to its reserves. The one-month uptick in Russian gold reserves — 200,000 ounces — is approximately equal to the entire annual output of Barrick Gold’s Turquoise Ridge gold mine in Nevada. 
At that same rate — 200,000 ounces per month — in a mere five months, Russia would add to state gold reserves the equivalent of the entire annual output of Barrick’s massive Goldstrike mine in Nevada. 
Currently, Russian gold reserves rank seventh in the world. It’s clear that there is a concerted effort by Russian authorities to build up the country’s gold reserves as part of a national strategy to negate the effects of economic warfare waged by the United States. 
Rickards, in his 2011 book “Currency Wars,” theorized that Russia and China could combine their gold reserves to form a global gold-backed currency to compete against the U.S. dollar. Currently, Russian reserves stand at roughly 1,500 tonnes, with Chinese reserves totaling over 1,800 tonnes (according to China — it’s likely more), which would amount to a combined total of roughly 3,300 tonnes of gold. 
The U.S. is about to lose overarching control of policymaking within the International Monetary Fund (IMF), thus the U.S. lockup on global gold is about to vanish, according to Business Insider. 
Imagine for a moment the distinctly real possibility that Russian-Chinese alliance could exercise indirect (or even direct) control over the IMF’s gold reserve of over 2,800 tonnes. Russian, Chinese and IMF gold combined would equal roughly 6,100 tonnes, and would allow for direct competition with the U.S. gold reserves, estimated at 8,100 tonnes. 
Russia and China have realized that the petrodollar is wielded by Washington as it’s weapon of choice when opposing a well-armed state, and clearly see the writing on the wall – thus working together to create a new global financial paradigm. 
The reality is that the United States is $20 trillion dollars in debt, and eventually the time will come when the U.S. economy begins to implode — and all the fiat currency people are stuck holding will essentially be worth nothing more than the paper it’s printed on. Hard assets, such as gold and silver, should be bought and taken custody of while there is still an opportunity to do so, as a means of hedging against the potentially disastrous results of the U.S. using the petrodollar as a “weapon.” 
It’s not Russian nuclear weapons that people should fear, as the policy of mutually assured destruction essentially voids any benefit of a state launching a first-strike nuclear attack. The true threat to America is our economic house of cards, built upon the back of a neoliberal trade policy that puts the “rights” of corporations over that of people . 
Ultimately, the United States, Russia and China are all controlled by centralized power-hungry tyrants attempting to command powerful global bureaucracies like the IMF, the World Bank, SWIFT, New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Share Google + T. Mohr

A former Virginia police officer and U.S. Navy veteran, whose trial for murder begins this week, told a witness, “this is my second one,” after killing an unarmed 18-year-old black man in April 2015. 
While unclear whether or not the jarring statement amounted to a boast, the camera on ex-Portsmouth Officer Stephen Rankin’s Taser recorded him saying this to a Walmart employee mere seconds after he fatally shot unarmed teen and alleged shoplifter William Chapman in the store’s parking lot in April 2015. 
Rankin had, indeed, killed another unarmed man, Kirill Denyakin — under circumstances similarly and sufficiently questionable to earn three years’ administrative leave — just four years prior to the shooting for which he now stands accused of first-degree murder. 
During the final pretrial hearing on Tuesday, the Guardian reported , Rankin’s lead defense attorney, James Broccoletti, argued the former officer’s “statement is not probative of anything,” in an unsuccessful attempt to have it suppressed. 
Prosecutors countered to Judge Johnny E. Morrison they should not have to “sanitize the evidence” surrounding the fatal shooting. 
“The defendant made the comment, not just in the presence and earshot of a witness, but to the witness,” argued Commonwealth’s Attorney Stephanie N. Morales , who heads the case against Rankin. 
Although Morrison had previously disallowed direct statements to jurors concerning Rankin’s fatal shooting of Denyakin, as the Guardian noted , it now appears the officer’s prior use of deadly force will play an albeit limited role in the prosecution’s case. 
Troubling details about the killing of unarmed 26-year-old Kazakhstani cook, Kirill Denyakin, on April 23, 2011, would seem to suggest a glib tone in the officer’s later statement to the Walmart employee. 
Rankin responded to a call about Denyakin drunkenly pounding on the door of a residence where he had been staying with friends. Alleging the cook reached for his waistband and then charged toward him, Rankin shot Denyakin 11 times in the chest and limbs, as The Free Thought Project reported . No weapons were recovered on Denyakin’s body or at the scene — but when the man’s family filed a $22 million civil suit against the officer, the situation took a dark turn. 
Defending his use of deadly force, Rankin — who had chosen a photograph of a dead Serb who had been lynched by the Nazis in 1943 as his Facebook profile picture — took to a local newspaper’s website, posting roughly 250 comments derisively attacking Denyakin’s character and insulting his family’s attempt to seek compensation, writing : 
“22 mil won’t buy your boy back … let alone a habitual drunk working as a hotel cook.” 
Weeks prior to that deadly interaction, one of the officer’s supervisors cautioned senior commanders Rankin was “dangerous” and likely to harm someone. Further revelations included Facebook posts in which the cop referred to his firearms case as “Rankin’s box of vengeance.” 
A grand jury refused to indict Rankin for the Denyakin’s killing — and though the department placed him on administrative leave for nearly three years, it took just over a year after his return to active duty for Rankin to fatally shoot Chapman under circumstances suspicious enough to now stand accused of murder. 
On the morning of April 22, 2015, Portsmouth Walmart employees summoned police to report a shoplifter. Rankin responded and confronted 18-year-old Chapman in the store’s parking lot. Several witnesses reported seeing Rankin attempting to handcuff the teen, but their observations of what happened next differ to some degree. 
Two construction workers said Chapman broke free from the officer, knocking his Taser to the ground; but, in speaking to separate reporters afterward, one described the man “ whaling on ” the officer, the other noted the pair’s subsequent interaction was a “ tussle ” in which the teen had not been close enough to physically strike Rankin. 
In a report , pathologists noted Rankin would have been at least 30 inches away from Chapman when he was shot, and the medical examiner did not find gunpowder burns or residue suggestive of a point-blank or near point-blank shooting. No stolen items were listed among the victim’s personal effects. 
Further, body cam footage recorded Rankin holding his Taser, but abruptly and perhaps conveniently, if not outright suspiciously, stopped for the 15 seconds surrounding the shooting — only to pick up after the deadly interaction, with the Taser on the ground. 
Chapman’s family’s attorney, Jon Babineau, recounting what he was told for Pilot Online , said in December, “The video was operational up until just before the shooting, and then it was not operational for about 15 seconds,” though an unnamed source told him the gap had been caused by a “power source issue” and did not necessarily believe the tape had been edited. 
In September 2015, a grand jury indicted Rankin for murder and the illegal use of a firearm. 
Rankin has since been terminated from the Portsmouth force and continues to maintain his innocence. 
Jury selection for the murder trial is slated to begin this morning. Share Google + Fred Ziffel 
Anytime the calculated death of a human being is forced by another knowing these actions are not ABSOLUTELY necessary and there was no other immediate threat to life, the act of taking or ending said life becomes murder. Who the perpetrator is, or what his/her occupational profession is, is totally irrelevant. Murder is not justifiable. 
I hope they prosecute this vigorously and relentlessly. Bill Allyn 
Justice System Reform List America has a serious, institutionalized, systemic law enforcement problem. Over the last 4 decades, our law enforcement has become increasingly militarized, putting every citizen at risk of being shot and killed for nothing more than reaching for their wallet, as instructed, or less. This may increase safety for police officers (debatable, in the long run), but at the expense of making American citizens far less safe, which is the exact opposite of the goals of law enforcement. We need to create systems that bring back accountability within every level of the justice system. Nationally, we need to: 1. Create citizen oversight committees with powers of subpoena and prosecutorial discretion for every law enforcement agency in the country. A special independent prosecutor must be assigned immediately for officer-involved shootings. Committee members should be randomly selected and replaced often, like grand jurors, to avoid corruption. 2. Require law enforcement officers to be personally insured to protect taxpayers from lawsuits. Too risky for insurance? No insurance, no badge. Insurance could be partially publicly subsidized. 3. Require every law enforcement officer to wear a camera. No camera, no gun. Also, implement GPS tracking on all police cars and cameras. 4. Require yearly psyche tests to screen out potentially abusive officers. 5. Require random drug and steroid tests. 6. All police agencies must keep a database of every officer-caused civilian injury, shooting or killing, and that data must be periodically transmitted to a third-party, non-biased national database. 7. Any officer involved in a shooting must be alcohol and drug tested immediately. 8. Officers should be made aware of studies on abuse of power, such as the Stanford Prison Experiment and the Milgram experiment on obedience to authority figures. Ensure there are clear policies on use of force. 9. More training to deal with mentally ill, or a mental illness crisis unit. More training and encouragement to use peacemaking, conflict resolution, and de-escalation skills. Increase educational requirements, focusing on psychology, sociology, and social work. 10. Create a special number (third party, independent of police) to report police brutality. Victims of police brutality and the families of police shootings should immediately be appointed an attorney to represent their position/case. 11. Create national database of abusive officers, so they don’t just get hired elsewhere. 12. Reverse militarization of police forces. Take away military weapons, APC’s, uniforms, and especially the attitude. Police officers are civilians, not a branch of the military. Require at least 5 years between active duty military and civilian police employment. Keep SWAT/military weapons and equipment under lock and key only to be used in genuine emergencies. Quit viewing the community you police as a “war zone”. 13. Prohibit television shows that glorify bad, illegal, or unconstitutional policing, such as “Cops”. Glorifying these behaviors creates a dangerous situation for American citizens and should not be tolerated. 14. Increase community outreach. Hire officers from the community. Officers need to be more in touch with the people they are sworn to protect. 15. End no-knock raids. It is perfectly legal for a home owner to respond to a break in with gun in hand, which gets them killed when the police are the intruders. This makes it unreasonably dangerous on citizens, especially when cops often go to the wrong address. 16. Reform forfeiture laws to protect citizens’ property rights and due process. No forfeiture proceedings until after conviction. All forfeiture proceeds go directly to the victims of police brutality and the families of police shootings. 17. End drug prohibition/war on drugs. Use harm reduction strategies. 18. End private prison industry. 19. Create a national organization dedicated to these ideals. Jamieson

Sad that there will be lots of tax-dollars spent just to simply let him walk away, but then, that will satisfy the sheep, as did Hillary’s ‘exoneration’….. As Bill’s ‘Limited Hangout Op’– $650m spent on a blowjob – to hide selling missile secrets to the Chinese. 
Treason runs deep in the White, these last 30 years. 
The US military is in Syria, helping ISIS, and US planes recently bombed and murdered over 100 civilians. Treason and murder.

Ever try Googling someone only to come up with basic information and maybe a link or two to an outdated social media profile? There’s a new website going around that promises to reveal much more than just a simple google search can show you. 
Been issued a speeding ticket? Failed to stop at a stop sign? What about your family members? And friends? If you are like most of us, the answer to at least one of those questions is “yes”—the vast majority of us have slipped up at least once or twice. 
An innovative new website — Instant Checkmate is now revealing the full “scoop” on millions of Americans. 
Instant Checkmate aggregates hundreds of millions of publicly available criminal, traffic, and arrest records and posts them online so they can easily be searched by anyone. Members of the site can literally begin searching within seconds, and are able to check as many records as they like (think: friends, family, neighbors, etc. etc.). 
Previously, if you wanted to research someone’s arrest records, you might have had to actually go into a county court office—in the appropriate county—and formally request information on an individual. This process may have taken days or weeks, or the information might not have been available at all. With websites like Instant Checkmate , however, a background check takes just a few clicks of the mouse, and no more than a minute or two. 
While preparing this article, I decided to run a quick search on myself to give the service a real-world test. To my dismay, the search revealed several items I’d long forgotten—one of them being for the possession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years old. “possession of a fake ID I was (embarrassingly) issued back in college when I was just 18 years old” 
After searching myself and finding those records, my curiosity was piqued, and I began researching family members—apparently my aunt Susanne isn’t a very good driver, judging by the numerous traffic citations that showed on her record. 
One of the most interesting aspects of Instant Checkmate is that it shows not only criminal records, but also more general background information like court records, various types of licenses (FAA, DEA), previous addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, estimated income levels and even satellite imagery of known addresses—it’s really pretty scary just how much information is in these reports. 
In addition to giving information on the specific person you search for, the report also includes a scrolling list of “local sex offenders” for whatever region you’ve searched—along with a map plotting out the locations of those offenders. I started perusing the ones that showed up in my report, and I was absolutely blown away when I stumbled upon my junior high school wrestling coach’s mug shot.

Clinton wins “by a landslide” — in the corruption department. So says columnist, New York Times bestselling author, and admitted Clinton “bagman” Jeff Rovin. Initially presenting his story anonymously in the National Enquirer , Rovin subsequently revealed his identity in a Monday interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Among his striking claims: The Clintons have an “open marriage,” Hillary has had affairs with both men and women, and he paid off reporters to keep the copious Clinton dirt hush-hush. And these allegations are backed up by 24-years' worth of documentation. 
Rovin’s appearance on Hannity (video below) adds further weight to his claims, as people often associate the Enquirer with fanciful tales. Yet as Hannity himself pointed out, that paper has at times broken major stories, catching the rest of the media napping. Hannity cited scoops concerning O.J. Simpson, John Edwards’ mistress, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson’s out-of-wedlock child, Tiger Woods’ marriage woes, and others. In fact, Rovin said that such Enquirer stories are, ironically, “probably better vetted than most of the stories in other media” because they’re “so controversial.” 
Of course, the Enquirer 's scoops almost invariably involve salacious matters, and the Clinton story is no exception. Yet most significant are Rovin’s disclosures about media suppression of truth — and efforts to destroy people such as Monica Lewinsky. 
Rovin explains that as a Hollywood reporter in the '80s and '90s, his close relationship with the Tinseltown power set and press allowed him to become, as he put it, “‘a fixer’: someone who helps stars keep embarrassing stories out of the press.” Rovin did his job so well that in 1991 he was asked to work for a rising political couple who, together, were an embarrassing-story-disgorging machine: Arkansas governor William Jefferson Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham. As he wrote : I was informed that these stories would involve rumors of Bill Clinton' s many sexual dalliances and an alleged ongoing affair of Hillary Clinton with a male member of her law firm, Vince Foster, as well as a female mover-and-shaker in Hollywood. For a retainer of $4,000 a month — paid by a third party, not the campaign — I was told to keep these stories hush-hush in one of two ways: by trading access to the Clintons for “positive” interviews, or by paying the reporters. The payments were always cash, usually delivered in a movie theater or restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, and came in two denominations: $100 for a heads-up that a bad story was coming; or considerably more to kill the piece. 
Rovin’s claims align perfectly with the recent WikiLeaks revelations about direct collusion between the corrupt mainstream media and Clinton campaign; among the examples are a New York Times reporter giving the campaign veto power over quotations, a CNBC reporter advising the campaign, and CNN commentator Donna Brazile forwarding Clinton a debate question prior to a March face-off against Bernie Sanders (yes, Sandernistas, the fix was really in). 
Yet bribery wasn’t the only method for getting stories spiked; deception was another. As Rovin told Hannity, reporters “were paid to soften the stories.… What would happen is, if we got wind of a story from the tabloids, chances were pretty good it would end up in one of the mainstream newspapers or magazines. We would then contact one of those people and say, ‘This isn't true, don't run it.’” 
And this apparently does ring true to Hannity, who spoke of the evidence he saw, saying to Rovin, “I went through with your editor everything that you had. You do have ledgers; you did have the faxes with the letterhead and the timestamps. The Clintons know you…. They know you fixed things for them.” 
And Rovin says this fixing became a full-time job, as the Clintons committed continual sexual indiscretions in what he described as a “polyamorous” and “open” marriage — which matches the “open borders” Hillary said, in an e-mail, that she wanted. 
Rovin appears to believe the Clintons’ sexual depravity was so all-consuming that it distracted Bill from the business of running the country. He cites as the worst example of judgment the bachelor party in March 1994 for Clinton’s half-brother, Roger Clinton, who, in quintessential Clinton style, was marrying a bride eight-months-pregnant. Prostitutes were present, and recordings were made — they included Bill Clinton. 
None of this will surprise those who know of Bill’s having taken 26 flights on billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s “Lolita Express,” but the recording was a problem: It was offered for sale to the Enquirer , says Rovin. This is when he says he swooped in and negotiated a deal to keep the recording suppressed. (Note: This would be a national-security concern, too. A foreign power that obtained such a recording conceivably could use it to blackmail the president.) 
Also in 1994, Rovin “arranged a meeting for Hillary and a woman in an exclusive Beverly Hills hotel,” he said . “I helped her slip out of a back exit for a one-on-one session with the other woman.” The journalist described this encounter as “sordid.” 
Rovin also reveals that he was part of a “team effort” to damage Monica Lewinsky; in fact, Rovin later felt so bad about this smear campaign that he apologized to Lewinsky personally. In addition, the journalist “told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary’s crew rummaged through [Vince] Foster’s office … to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal,” as WND.com put it . 
As to Rovin’s motivations for finally coming forward, he mentioned two significant factors. He told Hannity that when he learned that Enquirer editor Dylan Howard was doing the Clinton story and was naming sources he wanted kept confidential, he agreed to participate under the condition he could protect those sources. Second, he wrote in the Enquirer piece, “I am coming forward now because of the endless attention the alleged indiscretions of Donald Trump have received. Nothing I have heard comes close to the sexual and moral corruption of the Clintons — many of which have [sic] yet to be revealed.” 
Having said this, Rovin was dismayed at the campaign emphasis on dirt, saying to Hannity, “The election is too important to focus on this salacious material.” Identifying as a libertarian, the journalist expressed the common idea that politicians’ sexual indiscretions are none of anyone’s business and should be beyond scrutiny. And while many issues are more important — such as Clinton’s internationalist, open-borders dreams; amnesty plans; warmongering stance vis-à-vis Russia; and radical social agenda — that common idea is also a mistaken idea. 
Question: Is there any sexual indiscretion a politician could commit that would bring his psychological fitness into question? What if a person habitually engages in bestiality? Would you want such an individual managing your finances or babysitting your child? If not, why not, if “private” sexual behavior has no bearing on whether the person can “do the job”? 
If so, however, then would you want such a person’s finger on the nuclear button? 
Now, what kind of sexual depravity is not a red flag? 
During the Bill Clinton years, “Character doesn’t matter” became a meme used to justify Clinton corruption. But would you want to be pulled over by a cop with bad character or have your car repaired by a mechanic with same? Character is integral to everything we do . 
The Bible speaks of “eyes blinded by sin,” “For the eye altering alters all,” wrote poet William Blake. Habitually engaging in wrongdoing and (as man will do) rationalizing it away — which is when we deny reality — causes us to lose touch with reality. Twisting the truth in our own minds twists our minds; conning ourselves corrupts our judgment. The eye altering… 
Hillary Clinton is poised to continue the “fundamental change” Barack Obama infamously promised. But do we really want someone in an altered state altering these United States? Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment

""The Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans,” hacking “American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions … in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election,” Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told Chris Wallace of Fox News in the third and final debate before the November election. 
But Wallace did not even ask about who hacked her e-mails, some of which have been made publicly available by WikiLeaks. Wallace asked Clinton about a private speech she had delivered to bankers in Brazil, in which she said she dreamed of “open borders” throughout the Western Hemisphere. But because Wallace had noted that the source was WikiLeaks, Clinton chose to discuss how the information had been obtained, rather than her shocking statement that she wants America’s borders to be open to any person in the Western Hemisphere who desires to come to the United States. 
Of course, that would most likely include the majority of the population of North and South America. Certainly it would be millions of immigrants, at the very least. 
Donald Trump countered Clinton’s bold claim that Russians hacked her e-mails, saying that she “has no idea whether it’s Russia, China, or anybody else.” 
In rebuttal, Clinton simply repeated her claim, and chastised Trump for even questioning the integrity of U.S. intelligence officials who have taken an oath to defend the country. 
Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the hacks were perpetrated by the Russian government, or at least that there was strong evidence for such. Should the Obama administration be announcing this to the general public? However, considering that the White House has demonstrated so little concern for the well-being of the United States, it is not surprising that Obama would opt to reveal this information less than a month before the election — an action designed to help the candidate of his political party. 
Of course, Clinton defended U.S. intelligence agencies as above politics. But the reality is that politics has clearly played a role in some decisions of intelligence agencies, such as in 2012, when the CIA interjected itself in the last political campaign by creating Benghazi talking points. And then there was the distortion of analysis on ISIS and Syria by SOUTHCOM — the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for all military activities in South America and Central America — which conformed to Obama’s foreign policy position. 
If the Russians were able to hack into Clinton’s e-mails when she was secretary of state, because she was so careless (at best) as to use a private e-mail server, then does that not offer a reason that she should have been indicted? 
Hillary did not tell the truth when she claimed that 17 intelligence agencies had determined the Russians were responsible for the hacking. Only two agencies — the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) — have even addressed this issue, and their conclusion is somewhat different from Hillary’s interpretation of it. The joint statement by DHS and DNI was that the hacks are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts, with the presumed intention to interfere with the election process in the United States. 
Certainly, the Russians have a history of interfering in the internal affairs of other nations — the KGB and other Soviet agencies regularly used disinformation to plant stories in the Western media. And, of course, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was a high-ranking KGB agent during the Cold War, has publicly stated that he would like to see the restoration of the Russian Empire of the Soviet Era. 
But all that does not prove Russia had anything to do with this specific hack. 
The accusation conforms with the narrative that the Clinton campaign has been spouting for the past few months: that Putin prefers Trump over Clinton. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Again, it is interesting that when it was clear that Soviet dictators preferred someone other than Ronald Reagan as president, the Democrats did not consider that a reason to vote for Reagan. Rather, they argued that the United States should “deal” with Brezhnev, Chernenko, Adropov, and Gorbachev, and were highly critical when Reagan did not do so in the early years of his presidency. 
Clinton herself vowed to have a “reset” on relations with Putin and Russia when she became secretary of state; however, relations have clearly deteriorated with Russia since she and Obama took over American foreign policy. 
Others do not buy the Russian-hacker theory, anyway. Willliam Binney, a former high-ranking intelligence officer with the National Security Agency, recently told radio host Aaron Klein that he believed it is more likely it was a “disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker” who is responsible. Binney even argued that the FBI has long had access to the database of the NSA, and because of that, “if the FBI really wanted [the e-mails of Clinton], they can go into that database and get them right now.” He insisted that the NSA has all of Clinton’s e-mails, including the deleted correspondence. 
Judge Andrew Napolitano, speaking on Fox Business’s Judge Napolitano's Chambers , challenged the Clinton assertions, declaring bluntly, “the Russians had nothing to do with it.” 
The entire discussion of the role of the Russians in passing the information on to WikiLeaks is a diversion from the startling statement Clinton made to Brazilian bankers: that she wants no borders in the Western Hemisphere. This means that it is highly likely that a President Hillary Clinton will follow the pattern of President Barack Obama, who has regularly ignored laws, such as those concerning immigration, with which he does not agree. 
So, the entire discussion of whether WikiLeaks obtained its information from the Russians or someone else is important, but if Hillary Clinton’s “dream” of a borderless Western Hemisphere were to come true, no one would have much motivation to hack into the e-mail of an American secretary of state. After all, how long could the United States continue to exist, in any meaningful way, without borders? Please review our Comment Policy before posting a comment

Close Intuihub officials say the particular thing needs to incorporate the latest technology if it wants to stay relevant. NEWS October 26, 2016 Vol 52 Issue 42 · News · Technology 
SAN FRANCISCO—Explaining how their company was poised to usher in a bold new era of innovation, founders of local startup Intuihub told reporters Wednesday that their mission is to explore the intersection of technology and another thing. 
“When you look at where the world is going right now, it just makes a lot of sense to take cutting-edge technology and incorporate it into this other thing,” said Intuihub co-founder Martin Fiske, who explained that the other thing will be modernized and streamlined once it is integrated with the latest technological breakthroughs. “We’re looking out at an exciting new frontier, one in which technology will be used to push the boundaries of what the other thing is capable of.” 
“And we believe there’s no limit to what we can accomplish when we take technology and the other thing and put them together,” Fiske added. 
Intuihub will reportedly employ groundbreaking advancements in technology to take the other thing in a variety of new and intriguing directions, including some directions, company officials promised, that have never before been imagined. According to the startup’s founders, their work will forever change the way people think about and interact with the thing. 
Fiske, who reportedly began his career working solely with the other thing but soon realized that adding technology to what he was doing would “open amazing new doors for the thing,” told reporters that his company has an incredible opportunity to revolutionize both technology and the other thing. Five years from now, he said, the thing is likely to be completely unrecognizable by today’s standards. 
He pointed out that Intuihub is already disrupting the entire landscape by using technology to make the other thing more accessible and convenient. 
“Technology is evolving, and the other thing needs to evolve along with it,” said Fiske, noting that no other company focusing on the other thing is using technology the way Intuihub is. “The synergy between technology and this thing will be so strong that when the two come together, they may actually create a third thing, one that we believe could be truly world-altering.” 
After describing their plans to launch a revolution that will change the lives of millions for the better, Intuihub founders confirmed they were also interested in partnering with brands to create more personalized experiences for the thing’s consumers.

AUSTIN, TX—Anxiously wondering what kind of impression he was leaving on university admissions officials, wealthy father Gordon Fring was said to be waiting restlessly for responses this week after mailing donations to his son’s top college choices. “I sent in contributions to eight different schools all over the country and haven’t heard anything back yet,” said Fring, who added that while he submitted large sums to each of the private universities, he knew that thousands of other high school seniors’ well-off parents had done the exact same thing, so at the end of the day, it was just a crapshoot. “I really hope I get positive news from Duke. My son’s wanted to go there forever, and I feel really good about the amount of cash I sent them, so hopefully I have a decent shot. Fingers crossed.” At press time, sources reported that Fring had become excited after receiving an envelope from Vanderbilt, only to quickly grow dejected upon opening it and finding a simple form letter thanking him for his gift.

Vitamin E is an important fat-soluble antioxidant compound that aids the body in neutralizing the harmful after-effects of oxidation of fats. Current research is even looking into the important role that this vitamin plays in stopping free-radical production, a key method of preventing the development of chronic diseases and aging. It is also a vital element in the overall maintenance of a healthy immune system. Some studies are even looking into its role in preventing degenerative mental imbalances such as dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. And while many of us may do well in taking extra vitamin E supplements, we can use an organic diet to get a large amount of the daily requirements for this powerful antioxidant lipid. In fact, there are many common foods with vitamin E. You probably have a few in your house right now. Foods With Vitamin E Here are fifteen foods with vitamin E that you should strongly consider adding to your diet. 1. Almonds Almonds are one the best vitamin E foods. Just an ounce of almonds offers a whopping 7.4 milligrams of vitamin E. You can also get your vitamin E needs in the form of almond milk and almond oils. We would recommend eating raw almonds, if possible. 2. Raw Seeds Select raw seeds , such as sunflower, pumpkin and sesame, are another common food with vitamin E. In fact, eating just ¼ of a cup of sunflower seeds gives you 90.5% of your recommended daily value, making them one of the best vitamin E foods you can eat daily. 3. Swiss Chard Swiss chard is easily one of the healthiest vegetables you can eat on a daily basis. Commonly known to be high in vitamin K, vitamin A and vitamin C, Swiss chard is another food high in vitamin E. Just one cup of boiled swiss chard greens will provide you with almost 17% of your daily recommended values. 4. Mustard Greens Similar to swiss chard, mustard greens are very nutrient dense and will provide a variety of health benefits. Not only are they one of the best vitamin E foods, but mustard greens are also high in vitamin K, vitamin A, folate , and vitamin c. Eating just one cup of boiled mustard greens contains about 14% of your daily dietary requirements. We would recommend eating organic mustard greens, if possible. 5. Spinach Spinach may not be your favorite veggie, but it is one of the best leafy greens you can add to your diet. Not only is it one of the best calcium foods and naturally high in folate, it’s also one of the best vitamin E foods as well. Just one cup of boiled spinach will provide you with approximately 20% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh spinach to your sandwiches to make them extra healthy. 6. Turnip Greens While turnip greens may have a slightly bitter taste, they are very high in many essential nutrients. Like the rest of the leafy greens on this list, just one cup will provide you with plenty of vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin C and folate. Not to mention approximately 12% of your daily requirements of vitamin E. 7. Kale Kale is another great cruciferous vegetable you should eat as often as possible. Kale is very high in many nutrients, in fact, just one cup of boiled kale can give you almost 6% of your daily vitamin E requirements. We would recommend eating organic kale, if possible. 8. Plant oils Most plant seed oils are very good sources for Vitamin E as well. The best oil with vitamin E is Wheat germ oil. In fact, one tablespoon of this oil holds 100% of your daily Vitamin E requirements. Sunflower oil is another excellent option, as it provides over 5 mg of the vitamin, and can easily be be used for cooking. Other great Vitamin-E-rich oils include hempseed oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil (with almost 5 mg of vitamin E), olive oil and safflower oil. We would recommend only buying oils that are cold pressed unrefined and organic. 9. Hazelnuts A perfect snack during a long workday, eating just one ounce of hazelnuts can provide you with approximately 20% of our daily requirements of vitamin E. For an alternative to eating nuts, try drinking hazelnut milk in your morning coffee instead of milk or flavored creamer. 10. Pine Nuts Add an ounce of these nuts to anything you please! One serving contains 2.6 mg of vitamin E. You can also use pine nut oil for added health benefits. 11. Avocado Perhaps one of the tastiest foods with Vitamin E, avocados represent natures creamiest, oil-rich food. Just half of an avocado holds more than 2 mg of vitamin E. Avocados are very easy to incorporate into your diet. We would recommend adding sliced avocados to your salad, a sandwich, or mashed up as guacamole! 12. Broccoli For generations now, broccoli has been considered one of the best detox foods , but it’s also one of the healthiest foods high in Vitamin E. Just one cup of steamed broccoli will provide you with 4% of your daily requirements. Broccoli may not be as nutrient dense as other Vitamin E foods on this list, but it is definitely one of the healthiest foods you can eat daily. 13. Parsley An excellent spice, parsley is another great Vitamin E food. Try adding fresh parsley to salads and dishes for an extra Vitamin-E kick. Dried parsley will also provide you with this important vitamin, but the fresher the better. 14. Papaya This popular fruit is most commonly known as one of the best vitamin C foods , but it’s also high in Vitamin E. Just one papaya will give you approximately 17% of your daily needs. Try adding fresh or frozen papaya to fruit smoothies, along with other fruity vitamin E foods on this list for an extra healthy snack! 15. Olives From the oil to the fruit, eating olives is an excellent way of getting your daily needs for vitamin E. Just one cup of olives can give you approximately 20% of your daily recommended amount. These are just a few examples of foods with vitamin E. There are plenty more that aren’t listed here. Which vitamin E food is your favorite? Let’s hear your thoughts below.

Comcast, News Corp., Disney, Viacom, CBS and Time Warner dominate US broadcast and cable television news, entertainment and sports, movie and TV production, theme parks, record labels, publishing, and for-profit online operations. On Saturday, the Wall Street Journal reported telecommunications giant AT&T and Time Warner agreeing to merge. Approval, if granted, would likely assure greater consolidation in both industries – benefitting corporate predators at the expense of the vast majority of consumers, giving them less choice than already, ensuring higher prices for poorer service. Hillary is a Wall Street, war profiteers, corporate predators tool, virtually certain to support this outrageous deal – likely to get FCC and Justice Department approval on her watch. Campaigning in Pennsylvania, Trump called the proposed deal another example of too few sources disseminating information to Americans, warning of “too much concentration of power,” manipulating people, telling them how to think. As president, if elected, he vowed to oppose it. He’s against jobs-killing TPP, NAFTA and similar deals. “Our jobs are fleeing the country,” he said. “They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries.” Hillary calls TPP the “gold standard in trade agreements,” sure to approve what Trump opposes. He calls friendly relations with Russia a good thing, praising Putin as “a leader…far more than our president has been,” saying “(i)f we have a (normal) relationship with Russia, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we could work together on it and knock the hell out of ISIS.” Hillary’s rage for endless wars to eliminate all sovereign independent governments risks nuclear confrontation with Russia, China and Iran on her watch. Trump is no peacenik, no paragon of virtue, yet he’s on the right side of vital issues discussed above. Hillary should terrify everyone – on the wrong side of virtually everything mattering most, the most ruthlessly dangerous choice for president in US history.

In recent days I have listened to so many national leaders tell us that Donald Trump is going to win the election and that this will usher in a new golden age of blessing and prosperity for America. Supposedly this is going to happen even though we continue to slaughter babies on an industrial scale, sexually-transmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades, the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than 10 times higher than in 1940, and approximately two out of every three Christian men watch pornography on a regular basis. Even though there aren’t any signs of widespread national repentance, we are supposedly going to be showered with wealth, favor, protection and good times for as far as the eye can see. You can believe this if you want, but it doesn’t have any basis in reality. The truth is that we live in a nation where just about every type of evil that you can possibly imagine is spreading like wildfire. Just look at the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. According to the CDC, there are 20 million new cases of sexually-transmitted disease in the United States every year. And last year, cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis grew at a very alarming pace … Cases of sexually transmitted diseases in the United States have reached new highs, including an increase in syphilis not seen since the mid-1990s, federal health officials said in a report this week. There were 1.5 million chlamydia cases in 2015 — the last year that numbers were available — a 6 percent increase from the year before, and about 400,000 infections of gonorrhea, or a 13 percent rise , according to a report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But syphilis cases increased to levels unseen since the mid-1990s. There were nearly 24,000 cases of primary and secondary syphilis cases last year, a 19 percent hike compared with 2014. We are a nation that has fully embraced the “free love” philosophy of the 1960s. We have sex with whoever we want, whenever we want, and we don’t seem to care about the consequences. As a result, the nuclear family is rapidly being destroyed. Back in 1940, 3.8 percent of all babies were born to women that were not married. Today, that number is over 40 percent . 2008 (the year Barack Obama was elected) was the very first year in our history when 40 percent of all babies were born to unmarried mothers, and we have now stayed at that level for eight straight years . If we want to make America great again, we can start by not sleeping with people that we are not married to. But of course an increasing number of Americans (especially our young people) are discarding traditional notions of love, marriage and sexuality completely. At one time we were told that the choice was between “gay” and “straight”, but now many people have decided that they want absolutely no limits. Miley Cyrus is among those that are now identifying themselves as “pansexuals”. The following comes from a recent article by Jennifer LeClaire … “My mom is like an ’80s rock chick—big blonde hair. … She loves being a girl,” Cyrus said. “I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I … hated it … I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a ‘P’ that should happen, for ‘pansexual.’” According to Google , a “pansexual” is “not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex, gender, or gender identity.” Millions of young girls look up to Miley Cyrus as a role model. We knew that this sort of thing was coming in the last days, but it is still hard to grasp how far America has fallen. And if you try to speak out against this wave of evil, you might just lose everything. For instance, the bakery in Oregon that didn’t want to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple has been forced to close their doors permanently … The Oregon bakery that made news after it refused to make a cake for a lesbian couple’s wedding has closed after legal battles left the business financial devastated, according to a Christian news site. Aaron and Melissa Klein, owners of Sweet Cakes By Melissa, have shut down their bakery, according to the store’s Facebook page. ‘We have closed Sweet Cakes. We appreciate everyone’s continued prayer and support,’ the post said. We live in a nation where the culture has been fundamentally transformed. According to a newly released Pew Research Center survey , an all-time high 57 percent of all Americans believe that marijuana should be legalized and only 37 percent are against it. With that kind of a margin, it is only a matter of time before marijuana is legalized all over the country. We also live in a nation that is absolutely addicted to watching other people have sex. And most Christian men cannot even speak out about this epidemic because they are doing it themselves. According to Charisma News , one survey found that an astounding 68 percent of all Christian men admit that they watch pornography on a regular basis. But even if we turned away from all of the other behaviors that I have just mentioned, there would still be no hope for our nation as long as we continue to murder babies on an industrial scale. Did you see the final debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? During that debate, Clinton made it exceedingly clear that she is in favor of abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy. The Democratic platform openly calls for taxpayer funding of abortion and a complete repeal of the Hyde Amendment, and Bill and Hillary Clinton have made abortion one of the central pillars of their very long political careers. Their hands are absolutely drenched with the blood of dead children, and the American people are about to reward her by making her the next president of the United States . So no, I don’t buy it when people try to tell me that America is on the verge of a new era of greatness. The truth is that we are a cesspool of wickedness and filth, and unless we repent we are going to reap a very bitter harvest from what we have sown for so many years.

Plus A List Of Health Benefits,"in: General Health While cow’s milk remains one of America’s most common daily drinks, it is interesting to note that it may also be the reason why many Americans experience gas , bloating and other forms of indigestion. When the average cow is given growth hormones, antibiotics, GMO feed, vaccinations and exposed to toxic conditions, it is no wonder that many humans experience negative effects from consuming pasteurized cow milk . Goat’s milk is a much healthier alternative, especially when it is raw and organic. Goats produce about 2% of the global milk supply and it is interesting that most of the populations of people who consume goat milks cite a lower incidence of allergies and digestive complaints. The Benefits of Goat Milk Goat’s milk offers a wide variety of health benefits, with very few of the negative side effects of drinking regular cow milk. 1. Reaction to Inflammation Some research suggests that one of the main benefits of goat milk is that it may benefit inflammation. Another reason why it is easier for people with bowel inflammation to drink goat’s milk, instead of cow’s milk. 2. Environmentally Friendly Goats requires far less space and food than cows. Typically, you can comfortably raise six goats on the same acreage as two cows. 3. Metabolic agent Studies done at the USDA and Prairie View A&M University, link goat’s milk to an increased ability to metabolize iron and copper, especially amongst individuals with digestion and absorption limitations. Besides drinking goat’s milk, you can also take a digestive enzymes supplement to help with this also. 4. Bio-availability Another main health benefit of goat milk, is that it is closer to human mother’s milk than cow’s milk is. Because it has a chemical make up that is much closer to human milk, it is easier to digest and assimilate in the human body. 5. “Smaller” Fat “Smaller” fat? Does that mean it has less fat? Not necessarily, it means that the size of the fat molecules in goat’s milk are much smaller than those found in cow’s milk. This makes goat’s milk easier to digest. 6. High in Fatty Acids While cow’s milk has about seventeen percent fatty acids, goat’s milk averages thirty five percent fatty acids, making it more nutritionally wholesome. In fact, up to 50% of people with lactose intolerance to cow’s milk find that they can easily digest goat’s milk, especially if it is raw. 7. Calcium-rich Many people worry that they need to drink cow’s milk for calcium intake and the prevention of bone loss. Goat’s milk also offers high amounts of calcium, the amino acid tryptophan, and much less side effects of drinking cow’s milk. It’s just one of the many foods high in calcium . 8. Anti-Mucousal While drinking cow’s milk is a common reason for allergies and excess mucous, goat’s milk is not. Cow’s milk is high in fat, which may increase mucous build-up. Moreover, the fat globules in goat’s milk are one ninth the size of those found in cow’s milk, another possible reason why it does not produce irritation in the gut. 9. Ultra-nourishing In Naturopathic medicine, goat’s are referred to as bioorganic sodium animals. They are also associated with vigour, flexibility and vitality. Cows are calcium animals known for stability and heaviness. Bioorganic sodium is an important element in keeping joints mobile and limber. Goat milk has traditionally been used in medicinal cultures to nourish and regenerate an over-taxed nervous system. Goat’s milk is also extremely nutrient dense. It has almost 35% of your daily needs for calcium in one cup. Extremely high in riboflavin, just one cup of goat’s milk offers 20.0% of our daily needs. Add to that high amounts of phosphorous, Vitamin B12, protein and potassium. In fact, Ghandi himself rejuvenated his own health after extremely long periods of fasting through drinking raw goat’s milk [ 1 ] . 10. Less toxic than Cow’s Milk Whereas most cow’s milk is pumped full of bovine growth hormones as well as a substance known as bovine somatotropin, a hormone specific for increasing milk production in an unnatural way, goat’s are rarely treated with these substances. Because of its use on the fringes of big agriculture, goat’s milk is not only more nutritious for you, but also less toxic. 11. May Boost Immune System Goat’s milk has the trace mineral, selenium, a key essential mineral in keeping the immune system strong and functioning normally. Why You Should Drink Goat Milk Over Cow’s Milk These are just a few of the many health benefits of goat milk. Not only does it contain more nutrients your body craves, but it also has less additives than cow’s milk. Go with the healthier choice. References: Time Magazine.

They spent a lot of money and personal resources to help Hillary Clinton out during the election, but not any more says CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg! After the liberal media tried to make him turn on one of his oldest friends, Peter Thiel, for donating to Donald Trump , Zuckerberg finally decided to fight back. Since Zuckerberg is still technically supporting Hillary for President, in the following video I suggest what his real motive may have been for lashing out with pro-Trump rhetoric, and why the person he’s defending doesn’t win Zuckerberg any humanitarian awards either… He wrote a scathing post, telling people that Facebook will stand for more than just the ideas of a few tech elite, but instead for the ideas of the people. Zuckerberg even acknowledged there are GOOD reasons that people support Trump : They believe strongly in smaller government They want a different tax policy They want a better health care system They want to maintain religious freedom They worry about American gun rights Or ANY other issue where he disagrees with Hillary He ended the post by saying: “That’s ultimately what Facebook is about: giving everyone the power to share our experiences, so we can understand each other a bit better and connect us a little closer together.” So, despite the fact that he still supports Hillary Clinton , I want to thank Mark Zuckerberg for having the common decency to acknowledge the Trump Train even though all his tech billionaire friends will attack him for it. Now let’s get this shared out everywhere so we can show the world that Hillary’s “network” is finally turning it’s back on her. In related news, could what happened just hours after the final debate be the REAL reason Zuckerberg came out of the closet as a pro-Trump keyboard warrior? Several hours after what was arguably Trump ’s best performance of the campaign so far, one of the world’s top political experts gave Trump the best news he could hope to hear… Danny Gold continues: If you love Trump , today just became a HECK of a lot better! A very well respected political professor from Syracuse has just given Donald Trump the best news of the entire election. Professor Helmut Norpoth stepped forward today, despite HUGE opposition from his peers, to announce that his scientific formula has predicted the TRUE results of the election. And the result is… There is an 87%-99% chance that Donald Trump will WIN the election! Heck yeah! See, at least there are still some people who have not been bought off by Hillary Clinton. According to Northrop, all the other predictions are based entirely on opinion polls, which are inherently wrong. Instead of opinion polling, Norpoth relies on statistics from candidates’ performances in party primaries and patterns in the electoral cycle to forecast results. His model has correctly predicted the victor in every presidential election since 1996. (H/T- The Gateway Pundit ) So if you wanted something to celebrate, I mean other than Donald Trump ’s epic win over Hillary Clinton at the final Presidential debate, then Helmut Norpoth has just given you exactly that. Now let’s help share this GREAT news to everyone else in the entire world. Let every Trump supporting Facebook friend you have know! First of all, Zuckerberg may be a flaming liberal, but he’s no fool. It’s no secret that Zuckerberg has enjoyed a cushy relationship with Obama and the White House over the past eight years, but a Trump presidency could pose a threat to Mark Zuckerberg’s current role as the self-proclaimed arbiter of “free speech.” As Facebook’s CEO, Zuckerberg has almost absolute control over what is, and what is not “acceptable” to believe in, or talk about on the Internet. Then, there’s the whole issue of who Zuckerberg was defending when he had his micro-aggression and temporarily boarded the “ Trump Train.” It’s not like he was defending Mother Teresa’s good name or something. Peter Thiel, the guy who is Zuck’s BFF that people were ragging on for donating to Trump , just happens to the chief henchman of the Bilderberg Group, and chairman of its steering committee. It’s worth noting too, that Peter Thiel is HARDLY Zuckerberg’s closest connection to the Bilderberg group. I won’t discuss it here, but he’s got another connection that hits MUCH closer to home, so before everyone gets all excited thinking that perhaps Zuckerberg isn’t such a bad guy after all, it’s more likely he’s just hedging his bets, and Hillary was probably fully aware of what he said ahead of time.

ONLY IN AMERICA - NBC News reported yesterday: ""...that as Florida's early voting gets underway, several organizations including a labor union found a unique way to get Miami residents to the polls.""""Many of them Latino, were greeted out front with taco trucks and a free shuttle bus to help them get to the polls downtown."" Back on October 19, just before the last presidential debate, NBC News also reported a ""wall"" of taco food trucks lined up against Trump. Actually, it was more like three taco trucks whose owners were just trying to capitalize on feeding the attending crowds. But, it sounded believable and compelling. Obviously, NBC's reporters have a thing for Mexican food. 
No, I'm not making any of this up. In fact, it took the collaboration of three NBC reporters Craig Stanley, Natalie Valdes, and Brian Latimer to write the less than 300 hundred word Florida taco truck story and create the dumb 48 second video. 
I've warned readers that during this crazy, unpredictable election season - it is virtually impossible to distinguish between outrageous stories found on this site - compared to political reality and the main stream media's stories. 
Yvanna Cancela, the political director of the Culinary Workers Union local 226 who helped organize the Florida event said: ""Our taco truck drivers drove all night and day to get from Las Vegas to Florida.""""Some of the taco meat is getting a little gamey because of the hot weather in the Nevada desert, but by adding enough hot chilies and Mexican spices voters won't be able to taste the difference."" 
When Yvanna was asked about whether the Clinton's Blow Jobs for Votes™ campaign would compete for voters she said: ""Everyone knows that the way to a man's vote is through his stomach!""""As you know, Latino men are known for their machismo and legendary sex drive.""""So men won't be lured away by an offer of free sex for their vote, we added saltpeter to our tacos."" Saltpeter, containing potassium nitrate, is a chemical compound known to aid in food preservation and diminish a man's sex drive. 
The Clinton's Blow Jobs for Votes™ campaign manager, Lucy Lewd, was outraged after hearing about the saltpeter laced tacos and obvious competing strategy to lure away male voters.

Lucy Lewd went on to say: ""In face of this new stiff competition, the Blow Jobs for Votes™ campaign will be doubling its efforts to win over male voters.""""After Madonna's offer to give men blow jobs for votes, late voting registration has gone through the roof.""""Our efforts to hire enough Madonna segregate poll workers has been difficult."" Lucy lamented: ""Young women who normally would be anxious at the chance to be involved in Hillary's campaign, such as girls enthralled with the ""Material Girl's"" sexual allure, intrigued by ""role models"" Paris Hilton's and Kim Kardashian's sex tapes, buy Kylie Jenner lip kits, and purchase all their clothes at ""Sluts R Us"", now hate men after all the Donald Trump woman hater stories."" Lucy added: ""The women who have come out against Trump are so convincing and endearing, many of these young women have become lesbians."" 
Clinton's campaign chairman, John Podesta, who has been the target for weeks for all his revealing Wikileaked emails said: ""This election isn't about tacos, blow jobs or lesbians, it's about American's number one enemy the Russians - who are meddling in our elections. ""The Clinton campaign has already donated $100 million to upgrade the nation's voting machines to protect against Russian intervention."" Smartmatic, a company controlled by billionaire businessman George Soros and who is a Clinton supporter, donating over $8 million to her campaign, has been rumored to be supplying all the new voting machines. 
A computer technician, who did not want to be identified, described some of the anomalies he observed after installing the new voting machines at various precincts in Florida where early voting as already started. He said: ""These new machines are really state-of-the-art, 12 inch color screens, a mouse-like pointing device, face recognition, and full audio capability."" 
He confessed: ""The only problem is when the voter points to any of the Republican candidates, their names disappear - pointing to any democrat candidate - the machine lights up and starts playing ""Happy Times Are Here Again."" He added: ""The presidential choices also seem a little biased."" With the machine's face recognition software, it can determine if the voter is a man or woman or even determine race, such as Latino.""""Any voter who tries to select Donald Trump for president is automatically given an electrical shock.""""Hovering over Hillary Clinton for president, if it's a male Latino, a mouth watering plate of tacos appear on the machine's screen and the machine starts playing 'Cielito Lindo' - for other men, a video of Madonna in sexy lingerie sucking on a microphone is displayed along with the ""I'm A Virgin"" song track.""

Spoof Investigations has just learned that the requirement US veterans pay back bonuses, given by mistake, has been suspended by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter. 
Mr. Carter has also been ordered into ""therapy"" by CIC Mr. Obama due to this problem with the veterans, which has been going on for years, plus other matters. 
Therapy will take place inside the hanger bay of an undisclosed aircraft carrier, where a special section next to the aircraft and other equipment will be roped off and equipped with a couch. 
Hanger bay ops will proceed at the same time. 
The California National Guard have been particularly hard hit in this veterans fiasco, lured to bonuses ten years ago when military enrollments were declining. 
Many were then found ineligible--a mistake by the military, not the veterans--and forced to pay back bonuses they had accepted, often crippling their household finances. 
It took news coverage for the government to finally act in the form of Mr. Carter's order to suspend these re-payments. Congress has ignored the problem for years. 
Veterans who had risked their lives received letters stating they would face ""debt collection action"" if they did not re-pay. 
How this problem has affected mental health amongst veterans is now under study. 
Mr. Carter is reported already troubled with the ""confusion"" of Syria and now Mosul, as to which group of allies he is supposed to be coordinating. 
Both battle scenes, specifically in Aleppo and Mosul, are currently causing ""dizziness"" in Secretary Carter at this time, an ongoing problem. 
""I have trouble standing up straight,"" he said yesterday. 
This additional veterans' problem, finally sinking in to Mr. Carter and the Military Establishment, with the news of this veterans abuse spreading, was ""the last straw"" in his confusion-dizziness problem. 
A spokesperson for Mr. Carter stated that what with al qaeda, al nusra, ISIS, and other militant groups fighting Assad and supporting the US position, his confusion over Syria keeps growing. 
Then there's Turkey involved with a lot of bitterness over the Kurds who are effectively fighting ISIS but wanting their own territory in northern Syria. 
And generally the problems in the middle east not only involve the US but Russia, Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Yemen, Israel and who knows who else. 
To throw this veterans abuse on top of the overall chaos of US foreign policy has nearly overwhelmed the Secretary. 
Accordingly, a session in the bowels of an aircraft carrier, with top psychiatrists smoothing the way on top of the noises of aircraft and machinery screaming here and there, will be just the ticket to put the Secretary back to his right mind. 
He could also be bunked just below the flight deck if he needs to stay on a day or so as part of his treatment.

Greggs bakery shops in Ashton, Manchester, Salford and Liverpool were targeted by angry mobs yesterday, after a hoax message on Twitter, announced that the company were withdrawing pasties from their product range. 
The Greggs pastie is renowned as the staple diet of the working classes, and its devotees can been seen walking around town centres clutching its famous blue bag with the ubiquitous hot, greasy snack poking out of the top. 
Thousands of the treats are consumed daily, by the lower ends of society, who cannot afford luxury foods such as baked beans or spaghetti hoops, and fears grew that there would be mass cases of starvation as low earners and benefit claimants were priced out of the food chain completely. 
A Red Cross spokesman told us that the situation was so bad, that they were flying back 50,000 corned beef hash and 25,000 sausage and baked bean slices that were on their way to Syrian refugee camps. 
Riot police and fire fighters were deployed in the affected areas, and police told us that by late afternoon the crowds had been dispersed and order had been restored. They did however say that there was still some areas of disorder in Liverpool, but they were hoping to restore order soon, as the police helicopter had circled low over the crowd dropping thousands of job application forms, which seemed to be scattering the rioters away from the trouble spots. 
Late yesterday afternoon the chairman of Greggs, Sir Fred Battenburg, told a hastily gathered press conference that they had been the victims of a malicious hoax, and that the company had no intentions of withdrawing its best selling product. He went on to say that the company did intend to remove an item from their shops next month, namely the fruit scone, as this was not a big seller with mainstream pastie eaters. He appealed for calm in the affected areas, and assured customers that the fire damaged stores would be open for business as soon as possible. 
Last night police reported that groups of angry pensioners and housewives had gathered outside Greggs shops in the stockbroker areas of Hale, Wilmslow, Bowden and Alderly Edge. A spokesman said the protesters were angrily tapping on the shop windows with umbrellas and shoe heels, and shouting ""shame on you""""how dare you"" and ""do you know who I am"" at staff who had locked the doors in panic. 
An elderly woman, believed to be chair of the Dunham Massey Womens Guild, Lady Dorothy Schiffer-Brains, was arrested by police and later charged with 'aggressively prodding a police officer with a rolled up copy of Cheshire Life. 
Lady Schiffer-Brains is due to appear before Knutsford magistrates later today.

Ousted TATA group chairman Cyrus Mistry finally spoke out regarding the development, terming that while getting the boot did hurt , it was nowhere in comparison to what he felt after reading dozens of pun-filled headlines over his name and ouster. 
“What the hell, yaar ? Whatever I pick up, all I read is: Mystery over Mistry’s ouster; Che-Mistry no more, TATA group sacks chairman; Mist yet to clear on why Mistry was ousted, TATA says tata to Mistry. I can’t take this anymore! Please stop. I can always find another job or even become a chairman of some other company if lady luck favors me, but will these Mistry puns ever end? I’ve had enough of this pun-ishment!” the ex-chairman cried out to The UnReal Times . The businessman was soon supported by Sixth Sense scientist Pranav Mistry, who tweeted, “I feel you, bro!” 
The mainstream media, however, shot back at Mistry, asking him to take a chill pill. “Sigh-rus Mistry clearly not happy over some witty puns, eh? ;)” tweeted Times Group chairman Vineet Jain. Jain’s tweet was soon followed by rival newspaper The Hindu publisher, N Ram’s tweet: “About time Cyrus gulps in some Citrus juice to calm himself. Ratan Tata’s right about the intolerance part – it’s coming from his own ex-chairman!” 
An upset Mistry mentioned that sooner or later, he would have to change his name if things continue this way. “The last thing I want now is Cyrus Broacha meeting me and the media saying ‘Cyrus broaches Mistry!’ AAARGH!” an angry Mistry cried. He was, however, consoled by actor Neil Nitin Mukesh. “Be happy you have a popular 2-word name and not a 3-word one. That’s much, much, much better! Seriously, seriously, seriously!” Neil Nitin Mukesh reportedly told him. 
Media-appointed BJP MP, the VHP’s Sadhvi Prachi, who usually asks people to go to Pakistan, got into a bit of a lighthearted mood herself. “If Cyrus doesn’t like what happened, he can go to Cyprus!” the Sadhvi exclaimed. The ex-chairman was also approached by Sports Minister Vijay Goel, who told him, “I can never get a selfie with Miley Cyrus. So let me at least get one with Mistry Cyrus.” 
Mistry’s biggest consolation and shoulder to cry on, though, came all the way from South Africa, from the quarters of wicket keeper Quinton De Kock. “I can’t tell you how it feels each time I trend on Twitter and see the tweets about me. Trust me, you’re much better off. You just can’t imagine how cocky some tweeters can get. Oops!” the keeper is supposed to have said. Tweet About Ashwin Kumar

A few months ago I freed myself from standard-procedure society, I broke the chains of fear that kept me locked up into the system. 
Via AnonHQ 

Since then, I see the world from a different perspective: the one that everything is going through change and that most of us are unaware of that.
Is Really Something Extraordinary Happening In The World? Why is the world changing? In this post I’ll point out the 8 reasons that lead me to believe it.
1. No One Can Stand The Employment Model Any Longer We are reaching our limits. People working with big corporations can’t stand their jobs. The lack of purpose knocks on your door as if it came from inside you like a yell of despair. People want out. They want to drop everything. Take a look on how many people are willing to risk entrepreneurship, people leaving on sabbaticals, people with work-related depression, people in burnout.
2. The Entrepreneurship Model Is Also Changing Over the past few years, with the explosion of startups, thousands of entrepreneurs turned their garages in offices to bring their billion dollar ideas to life. The vortex of entrepreneurship was to find an investor and get funded. To be funded was like winning the World Cup, or the Super Bowl. But what happens after you get funded?
You get back to being an employee. You may have brought in people not sharing your dream, not in agreement with your purpose and soon it’s all about the money. The financial end becomes the main driver of your business. People are suffering with it. Excellent startups began to tumble because the money seeking model is endless. A new way to endeavor is needed. Good people are doing it already.
3. The Rise Of Collaboration Many people have figured out that it doesn’t make any sense to go on by yourself. Many people have awakened from the “each man for himself” mad mentality. Stop, take a step back and think. Isn’t it absurd that we, 7 billion of us living in the same planet, have grown further apart from each other? What sense does it make to turn your back on the thousands, maybe millions, of people living around you in the same city? Every time it crosses my mind, I feel blue.
Fortunately, things are changing. Sharing, collaborative economy concepts are being implemented, and it points towards a new direction. The direction of collaborating, of sharing, of helping, of togetherness. This Is Beautiful To Watch. It Touches Me.
4. We Are Finally Figuring Out What The Internet Is The internet is an incredibly spectacular thing and only now, after so many years, we are understanding its power. With the internet the world is opened, the barriers fall, the separation ends, the togetherness starts, the collaboration explodes, the helping emerges. Some nations saw true revolutions that used the internet as the primary catalyst, such as the Arab Spring. Here in Brazil we are just starting to make a better use out of this amazing tool.
Internet is taking down mass control. The big media groups controlling news by how it suits best what they want the message to be and what they want us to read are no longer the sole owners of information. You go after what you want. You bond to whomever you want. You explore whatever you may want to.
With the advent of the internet, the small is no longer speechless, there is a voice. The anonymous become acknowledged. The world comes together. And then the system may fall.
5. The Fall Of Exaggerated Consumerism For too long, we’ve been manipulated to consume as much as we possibly can. To buy every new product launched, the newest car, the latest iPhone, the top brands, lots of clothes, shoes, lots and lots and lots of pretty much anything we could our hands on. Going against the crowd, many people have understood that this of way off. Lowsumerism, slow life and slow food are a few excerpts of actions being taken as we speak, pointing out by contradiction how absurdly we have come to organize ourselves.
Fewer people are using cars, fewer people are overspending, and more people are swapping clothes, buying used goods, sharing assets, cars, apartments, offices. We don’t need all of that they told us we needed. And this consciousness of new consumerism can take down any company living of the exaggerated end of it.
6. Healthy And Organic Eating We were so crazy we even accepted eating anything! It only needed to taste good, and everything would be alright. We were so disconnected that companies started to poison our food and we didn’t say anything! But then some people started waking up, enabling and strengthening healthy and organic eating. This is only to get stronger.
But what has this got to do with economy and work? Just about everything, I’d say. Food production is one of the basic fundamentals of our society. If we change our mindset, our eating habit and our way of consuming, corporations will have to respond and adapt to a new market.
The small farmer is getting back to being relevant to the whole chain of production. Even people are growing plants and seeds inside their homes as well. And that reshapes the whole economy.
7 .  The Awakening Of Spirituality How many friends do you have who practice yoga? What about meditation? Now think back, 10 years ago, how many people did you know by then who practiced these activities? Spirituality, for too long, was for esoteric folks, those weird-like and mystic people.
But fortunately, this is also changing. We’ve come to the edge of reason and rationality. We were able to realize that, with only our conscious mind, we can’t figure out everything that goes by here. There is something else going on and I’m sure you want to get hold of that as well.
You want to understand how these things work. How life operates, what happens after death, what is this energy thing people talk about so much, what is quantum physics, how thoughts can be materialized and create our sense of reality, what is coincidence and synchronicity, why meditation works, how it’s possible to cure using nothing but bare hands, how those alternative therapies not approved by regular medicine can actually work.
Companies are providing meditation to their employees. Even schools are teaching the young how to meditate. Think about it.
8 .  Unschooling Trends Who created this teaching model? Who chose the classes you have to take? Who chose the lessons we learn in history classes? Why didn’t they teach us the truth about other ancient civilizations? Why should kids follow a certain set of rules? Why should they watch everything in silence? Why should they wear a uniform? What about taking a test to prove that you actually learned?
We developed a model that perpetuates and replicates followers of the system. That breed people into ordinary human beings. Fortunately, a lot of people are working to rethink that though concepts such as unschooling, hackschooling, homeschooling.
Maybe you’ve never thought of that and even may be in shock. But it’s happening. Silently, people are being woken up and are realizing how crazy it is to live in this society. Look at all these new actions and try to think everything is normal we were taught so far is normal. I don’t think it is. There is something extraordinary happening.",english,2016-10-26T22:41:31.464+03:00,topinfopost.com,US,,There Is Something Extraordinary Happening In The World – And You Probably Didn’t Realize It Yet,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

But there’s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he’s willing to expose Hillary Clinton. 
Via AlternativeNews 

Now, he’s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate.
WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested : 
The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. Sounds familiar?
Scroll Down For Video Below! In Obama’s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American-made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan/Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria.
Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so-called “Friends of Syria” (aka Al Qaeda/ISIS) to back the CIA-led insurgency for regime change in Syria.
Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early 2013 after the Benghazi terrorist attack. In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks’ Julian Assange is now stating that 1,700 emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS.
JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over 30,000 emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton’s private email server while she was secretary of state. The 50,547 pages of documents span the time from June 2010 to August 2014; 7,500 of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what’s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base?
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn’t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it’s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases; hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs; feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case—or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can’t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand.
So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that’s there in those emails. There’s more than 1,700 emails in Hillary Clinton’s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.
It appears that Hillary Clinton committed perjury, just like her husband was caught doing as President.",english,2016-10-26T22:41:31.521+03:00,topinfopost.com,US,,WikiLeaks: Confirms Hillary Sold Weapons To ISIS,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Harvard scientists have developed a 3D printed heart on a computer chip, which can be used to study heart conditions without testing medical treatments on animals. The heart-on-chip is composed of a small piece of flexible polymer with integrated sensors that contains living human heart cells , which can mimic the physiological response of a human heart. 
The sensors collect data on the beating of the heart-on-chip, which can be used to study how tissue responds to drugs or toxins. 
Scientists from the Wyss Institute at Harvard University believe the technology is a more accurate alternative to testing drugs on animals, and hope it can decrease the number of animals used for testing. 
“We are pushing the boundaries of three-dimensional printing by developing and integrating multiple functional materials within printed devices,” Jennifer Lewis, senior co-author of the study said in a press release. 
Other organs, including bones, lungs, the liver, and gut can also be made into organs on a chip. 
However, it is noted that obtaining data from these chips is costly and can only be done using high-speed cameras or microscopy.

A Satanic Temple opens its doors in Massachusetts proud to display their ""religious"" symbols! But removing the Ten Commandments is OK? With up to 50,000 members in chapters around the world, TST has garnered colossal media attention in the last three years. Outside of New England, TST has taken legal action against the placement of edifices of the Ten Commandments in civic settings, including statehouses. The Satanist group has intervened in various school districts to contest prayer or challenge Christian clubs. Salem is headquarters to this Anti Christian group. 
(SALEM,Massachusetts) Horror is not contained to October 31st alone. A controversial Satanic temple has set up its international headquarters in Salem Massachusetts. Just one mile from historic sites where ironically in the 16th century witches were hunted and killed. 
The building is a former funeral home, inaugurated last month by activist Malcolm Jarry, a self-described “secular Jew” who co-founded The Satanic Temple (TST) in 2013. It also houses an art gallery in honor of the heathen idol Baphomet, a “sabbatic goat”. Behind the two-story building, an eight-foot tall statue of Baphomet sits in a plain shed, where visitors can pay to view it. 
With up to 50,000 members in chapters around the world, TST has garnered colossal media attention in the last three years. Chief among Jarry’s causes are marriage equality and women’s reproductive freedom. Any issue related to the government using religion to restrict individual freedom is also likely to engage temple leaders, some of whom staged a 2014 “Black Mass” at Harvard University to push the envelope on religious freedom. 
Outside of New England, TST has taken legal action against the placement of edifices of the Ten Commandments in civic settings , including statehouses. To illustrate how such displays violate religious freedom, the temple has insisted it be allowed to erect goat-headed Baphomet statues in the same locations. TST is also planning to take on some schools’ use of isolation, denial of bathroom access, and corporal punishment of children. For the 49-year-old Jarry, there is not much conflict between being Jewish and a Satanist. As a matter of fact, the two identities have come to inform each other, he said. 
“I see it like Buddhism,” said Jarry. “Satanism is something that can co-exist with being a Jew,” he said. 
In addition to Jarry’s belief that Judaism and Satanism can co-exist, there are parallels with how Judaism and Satanism have been branded by their detractors, he said. 
“The false accusations that have been thrown at Jews historically are similar to what some people say about Satanism,” said Jarry, mentioning accusations of blood libel and — more recently — fabricated allegations that Israel perpetrates genocide against Palestinian children. 
In recent weeks, TST has been in the news for one member’s attempts to deliver a Satanist invocation at Boston City Hall . The opportunity to open meetings with prayers is by invitation only, and only mainstream religions have ever been asked, said Jarry. 
“If the decision is that only we cannot deliver an invocation, then we will sue and we will win,” 
“We expect to be treated in the same manner as all other religions and will sue for all of the same rights,” said Jarry, adding that TST’s campaigns are fueled by “the importance of standing for freedom of expression and against tyrannical authority.” 
According to Salem city officials, only a handful of citizens have expressed concern about the Satanic temple’s arrival to one of New England’s top tourist destinations. TRUNEWS counted about 20 churches in Salem alone, and not one Christian expressed concern? Where is the church? The TST has a clear agenda to stop Christians from evangelizing and in their quest they are winning legal battles to do so. With each Christian symbol taken down or expression of faith being censored, this groups' agenda advances. Again I ask, where is the church?

Defense Secretary Ash Carter on Wednesday ordered a suspension in efforts to seek repayment of thousands of enlistment bonuses and tuition assistance mistakenly paid to members of the California National Guard. 
""While some soldiers knew or should have known they were ineligible for benefits they were claiming, many others did not,"" Carter, who is in Europe meeting with U.S. allies, said in a statement. 
""This process has dragged on too long, for too many service members,"" he said. ""Too many cases have languished without action. That's unfair to service members and to taxpayers."" 
Last week the Los Angeles Times reported that about 10,000 California National Guard troops had been ordered to repay enlistment bonuses - some of more than $15,000 - that were improperly given to them. The newspaper said audits revealed the California Guard had overpaid troops in order to entice them to join and meet enlistment targets more than a decade ago. 
Senior Defense Department officials have been told to assess the bonus situation and establish a ""streamlined, centralized process"" by the start of next year, Carter said in the statement. 
""The objective will be to complete the decision-making process on all cases as soon as possible - and no later than July 1,"" he said. 
The issue has caused outrage in Congress. Members from both parties have called on the Pentagon to drop efforts to reclaim the bonuses. 
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Fox News on Tuesday that if the Pentagon did not drop the effort to reclaim re-enlistment bonuses, lawmakers would move legislation on the issue.

Former member of the Federal Election Commission says fake ID's are a “potential way around a state that has a photo ID law in place."" A quick Google search reveals a plethora of fake ID vendors. Most popular are drivers license and student identification. This ease of availability of fake drivers licenses poses a danger to American national security. Fraudulent identification also increases the threat of voter fraud in certain states. 
(Vero Beach, FL) The use of fake drivers licenses isn’t just limited to teenagers drinking beer, but can be used by terrorists, illegal immigrants and fraudulent voters to go around barriers set up by law enforcement. The trend also poses a threat to this presidential election in states where voter ID laws are in place. 
Hans von Spakvovsky, former member of the Federal Election Commission and a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Caller that fake IDs are a “potential way around a state that has a photo ID law in place.” 
Paul Rozenweig, now a senior adviser to the Chertoff Group and a lecturer at George Washington University School of Law, told theDC that in his “personal view” the security of drivers licenses “has been underemphasized.” 
“We’ve done a great deal, for example, to make passports harder to forge, we’ve been much less successful in making domestic identification such as drivers license secure,” Rozenweig said. “The fact that 15 years after 9/11, we still don’t have a secure drivers license identification system in the United States that is hard to spoof and applies to all 50 states is a good example of how we haven’t put any emphasis on this.” 
TRUNEWS contacted four states out 7 arguably considered to have ""strict"" voter photo ID laws. At least in four states the Election Services representative did not express any concern with fake ID's for the coming election. All confirmed however, to not have any technology in place that would verify or decline a fake form of identification. In Wisconsin spokesperson Reid Magney said, 
""I'm not aware of how much a fake ID would cost, but I don't think someone is going to go through all that just to vote twice"" 
But what if voting twice isn't the goal? A person could be ineligible to vote for a number of reasons like criminal history or immigration status and use a fake ID to do so.The easy access to fake ID's provides a solid supporting argument to allegations and even video released by Project Veritas Action investigators depicting Democratic campaign officials encouraging non-citizens to vote. 
There is a whole unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) devoted to document fraud, and yet a quick search on Google yields credible fake ID vendors. Narcotics are accessible on the internet as well, but they require the use of software such as Tor in order to get to the “darknet.” Tor allows you to visit websites that are only accessible on the software’s browser and user’s locations and identities are hidden through the use of thousands of relays. On the other hand, there is a large community on Reddit openly discussing which fake ID websites are credible, offering sales and giving reviews on products. Drivers licenses and student IDs are the main types of fraudulent identifications available on the open internet. For passports one can visit a “dark marketplace” and purchase a fake Spanish passport for nearly $3,000. The subreddit “fakeid” has over 15,000 subscribers and keeps a list of “verified” vendors who the moderators have confirmed won’t scam users. Sources close to The Daily Caller have ordered fake drivers licenses from these vendors, all of which have bar codes that can be scanned, proper holographics, and proven to be effective at liquor stores or hotel check-ins. 
According to ICE: “ICE places a high priority on investigating document and benefit fraud. These types of fraud pose a severe threat to national security and public safety because they create a vulnerability that may enable terrorists, other criminals and illegal aliens to gain entry to and remain in the United States.” While ICE claims to place a “high priority” on fake IDs, sites such as reallygoodfakes.com have had a registered domain since 2010. Besides the key issues related to fake drivers licenses of illegal immigration and terrorism that ICE identifies, fake IDs can also enable voter fraud. 
Ian Smith, investigative associate at the Immigration Reform Law Institute, told TheDC fake IDs are commonly used by illegal immigrants to “obtain work, open a bank account, and rent an apartment.” We spoke with Leah Smith a spokesperson at Election Services in Mississippi and she seemed pretty confident in relying on poll workers this November 8th. 
""We have trained poll workers who know what a real ID looks like"".

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte sought to assure Japan on Wednesday that his high-profile visit to China last week was about economics, not security, and vowed to stand on Tokyo's side over the disputed South China Sea when the time came, even though Duterte reiterated his harsh words for long-time ally Washington, saying he might end defense treaties. The volatile Philippine leader's visit to Japan comes amid jitters about his foreign policy goals This follows weeks of verbal attacks on ally the United States and overtures toward China. Duterte last week announced in China his ""separation"" from the United States He later insisted ties were not being severed and that he was merely pursuing an independent foreign policy. His perplexing comments pose a headache for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has tightened ties with Washington while building closer security relations with Manila and other Southeast Asian countries as a counter-weight to a rising China. 
""You know I went to China for a visit. And I would like to assure you that all there was, was economics. We did not talk about arms. We avoided talking about alliances,"" he told an audience of Japanese businessmen. 
(TOKYO) - Duterte, speaking through a Japanese interpreter at the start of his talks with Abe, later said he would stand on Japan's side in the contentious matter of the South China Sea. 
Describing Japan as a ""special friend who is closer than a brother"", Duterte said after the meeting that Manila would work closely with Japan on regional issues of common concern and uphold the values of democracy, the rule of law and peaceful settlement of disputes including the South China Sea. 
Reading from a statement, he added: ""Today we have taken steps to ensure that our ties remain vibrant and will gain greater strength in the years to come."" 
INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY 
Both Tokyo and Washington have grown worried that the commitment under Duterte's predecessor, Benigno Aquino, to stand up to China in the South China Sea is under threat, although Japan has no direct territorial row with Beijing there. 
Japan has a separate dispute with China over tiny, uninhabited isles in the East China Sea, and has been keen to stress the importance of the rule of law. 
Abe, for his part, said he welcomed Duterte's efforts to improve Manila's ties with Beijing and - noting the South China Sea issue was one of international interest - said the two leaders had agreed on the importance of settling maritime disputes peacefully. 
Aquino angered China by lodging a case with an arbitration court in the Hague challenging the legitimacy of Beijing's maritime claims in the resource-rich sea. The court's ruling in July emphatically favored Manila but was rejected by China, which has warned Washington and Tokyo to stay out of the feud. 
Duterte earlier told an audience of Japanese business executives he did not pick quarrels with his neighbors, but had tough words for Washington. 
""I have declared that I will pursue an independent foreign policy. I want, maybe in the next two years, my country free of the presence of foreign military troops. I want them out,"" he said. 
""And if I have to revise or abrogate agreements, executive agreements, this shall be the last maneuver, war games between the United States and the Philippines military."" 
China claims almost the entire South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion worth of trade passes every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the sea, believed to have rich oil and gas deposits. 
Duterte has threatened to abrogate defense agreements with the United States several times but has yet to take any concrete action beyond cancelling some minor navy patrol exercises. 
In a pattern already becoming familiar, Duterte's foreign minister, Perfecto Yasay, tried to soothe concerns raised by the president's remarks. He told a news conference that Manila would respect treaty obligations as long as mutual interests converged. 
Japan and the Philippines also signed notes on two yen loan projects worth up to 21.4 billion yen ($205 million), including one to build two patrol boats for the Philippine Coast Guard to boost its capacity for search and rescue and law enforcement.

REUTERS/Daniel Dal Zennaro/Pool/File Photo 
Reuters Senior Vatican Correspondent Philip Pullella has publishing a scathing report which looks into the secretive and reclusive management style of the first Jesuit Pope. Pope Francis has elected to pursue a secretive management style to push through progressive doctrines. Pope Francis kept nearly the entire Vatican hierarchy in the dark about his decision to ordain Father Simoni. Father Simoni: “I did not believe either my ears or eyes. The pope said it, but I could not believe it. 'Can he be talking about another Ernest?' I said to myself."" Pope Francis carries his own black briefcase, keeps his own agenda, and makes many of his own calls. In contrast: Benedict XVI and John Paul II, worked hand-in-hand with the Vatican bureaucracy, known as the curia. Internal critics say he relies too much on ‘snap’ judgments. Virtually ‘impossible’ to determine who is really close to Pope Francis. Francis's two priest-secretaries are Father Fabian Pedacchio Leaniz from Argentina and Father Yoannis Lahzi Gaid from Egypt. Source close to Pope: ""He does not want any filters.” “Sometimes he will tell one of his secretaries 'so-and-so is arriving in a few minutes' and that is the first they hear of it. Sometimes he tells one without telling the other."" ""He is sometimes like the leader who says 'I don't care what the generals say, I will tell Lieutenant so-and-so to take that hill’.” 
(VATICAN CITY) Father Ernest Simoni, a 88-year-old Albanian, was watching Pope Francis on television this month when, to his astonishment, he heard the pontiff mention his name. 
Francis announced that the simple, white-haired Roman Catholic priest, who had spent many years in jail during Albania's communist dictatorship, was to become a cardinal. 
It was the first that Simoni, or any of the other 16 new cardinals named by Francis at the same time, had heard of their elevation to the prestigious rank. 
""I did not believe either my ears or eyes,"" Simoni told Reuters in Albania. ""The pope said it, but I could not believe it. 'Can he be talking about another Ernest?' I said to myself."" 
But more significantly, the pope had also kept nearly the entire Vatican hierarchy in the dark about his decision, which he announced on Oct. 9 to thousands of pilgrims. 
The episode illustrates how Francis has used his own distinct management style to try to shake up the Church since his election in 2013. He is keeping his cards close to his chest as he tries to push through a progressive agenda to make the Church more welcoming in the face of conservative opposition. 
Interviews with a dozen current and past Vatican officials and aides paint a portrait of Pope Francis, a Jesuit who turns 80 in December, as eschewing filters between him and the outside world. He carries his own black briefcase, keeps his own agenda, and makes many of his own calls. 
In contrast, his two immediate predecessors, Benedict XVI and John Paul II, worked hand-in-hand with the Vatican bureaucracy, which is known as the curia. 
Behind Francis's approach is a clear mandate, received from the worldwide cardinals who elected him in 2013, to overhaul the curia. 
Over the decades the Vatican's administration has collected some of the Church's most orthodox officials, partly because of the lieutenants that Francis's two highly-conservative predecessors called to their entourages in Rome. 
As a result, Francis believes that only by reducing the power of the curia – including surprising it on some decisions - can the 1.2 billion-member Church embrace those who have felt marginalized, such as gays and the divorced. 
The approach has scored Francis some victories, such as bypassing conservative bishops to streamline the procedures by which Catholics can obtain marriage annulments. 
There have also been setbacks, such as putting too much power in one cardinal's hands to resolve financial problems and later having to rein him in. 
Some internal critics say he relies too much on snap judgments and others have urged greater transparency. They say his decisions to set up new structures, such as an economy ministry and an external advisory council of eight cardinals from around the world, were divisive and that he could have enacted change by putting new people at the top of existing departments. 
NO FILTERS 

One of the most striking differences between Francis and his two predecessors is that it is virtually impossible to determine who, if anyone, is really close to him. 
The personal secretaries of Benedict and John Paul - respectively Georg Ganswein, now an archbishop, and Stanislaw Dziwisz, now a cardinal - were always at their side and became celebrities in their own right, the powerful gate-keepers to get to the pope. 
By contrast, few people know the identities of Francis's two priest-secretaries - Father Fabian Pedacchio Leaniz from Argentina and Father Yoannis Lahzi Gaid, an Egyptian. Both have other part-time jobs in the Vatican and do not appear or travel with him. 
""He does not want any filters,"" said a person who knows the pope well. ""Sometimes he will tell one of his secretaries 'so-and-so is arriving in a few minutes' and that is the first they hear of it. Sometimes he tells one without telling the other."" 
This person, like most of the others interviewed for this article, has had direct dealings with Francis and all spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to talk to the media. 
This year, an Argentine visitor told a guard at a Vatican gate that the pope was expecting him. Phone calls had to be made to determine he was not a prankster. The pope had not told anyone he had invited the visitor. 
One person close to the pope said he likes to manage this way because it gives him freedom to bypass rigid channels of communication and makes it impossible for anyone to become indispensable, as top aides of previous popes did. 
JOYFUL DESTRUCTION 

Francis likes to break rules and then change them once the shock has died down. Two weeks after his election, he included women in a liturgical service open only to men. Later, he ordered that the rules be formally changed worldwide. 
Pope Benedict's sudden resignation in February 2013 brought to a climax one of the most turbulent periods in modern Vatican history, including the arrest of his butler for leaking documents that exposed corruption and cronyism. 
Francis watched from afar as Benedict's papacy unraveled under the weight of successive scandals. 
After he was elected, he appointed trusted people to lower or mid-level positions in Vatican departments, where they can be his eyes and ears. For example, Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, also works in the department that decides who will become bishops. 
Monsignor Battista Mario Salvatore Ricca, an Italian who runs the Vatican guest house where the pope lives, was given a position at the Vatican bank as the link man between a supervisory commission of cardinals and the board of directors. 
""He is sometimes like the leader who says 'I don't care what the generals say, I will tell Lieutenant so-and-so to take that hill',"" said a source, adding that the pope enjoyed rattling an inefficient bureaucracy with what the source described as ""joyful destruction"". 
FIRST IMPRESSIONS 

Several of those interviewed said Francis puts much stock in his immediate gut feelings about people. When he takes a liking to someone he can become blind to their faults and when he does not, it is hard to reverse that first impression, they said. 
Francis was impressed by Cardinal George Pell of Sydney when he met the Australian in 2013. In meetings cardinals held among themselves before that year's conclave, the former Australian Rules football player stood out not only for his height and broad shoulders but also for his command of financial matters. 
Months after his election, Francis, hoping to put an end to Vatican financial scandals, moved Pell to Rome to head a new ministry, the Secretariat for the Economy. 
After initially giving him sweeping powers, the pope later significantly trimmed them back when other departments accused Pell of treating them in an overbearing way and of being condescending to the Italian-dominated curia. 
Pell's position in the Vatican has also been weakened by allegations of sexual abuse when he was in Australia. Pell denies the allegations and the pope has said he will withhold judgment until an Australian investigation is over. 
In another controversial appointment, Francis, acting on a recommendation, named Francesca Chaouqui, a 32-year-old Italian public relations expert, to a commission advising him on reform. On July 8, 2016, a Vatican court convicted her of helping to leak embarrassing internal documents to journalists. 
Insiders say the Pell and Chaouqui cases are examples of Francis making decisions too quickly. 
Even though his health is good, they say he feels he has little time left and many things still to do; that perhaps explains the hastiness of some of his decisions. 
Francis appears to enjoy sending signals that he alone is calling the shots. 
When his predecessors spoke to the media on papal flights they were always flanked by the secretary of state or the deputy secretary of state. The stage management suggested that behind the man in white, there stood a centuries-old bureaucracy. 
Under Francis, those prelates now stay out of sight in the front section of the plane.

The Directorate of National Insecurity--
The Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Director of the CIA, the Head of the National Security Agency,
The President´s National Security Advisor, the Chief of Homeland Security,
The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Intelligence,
The President of the Good Old USA--
All answer to the 1% in a plutocracy posing as ersatz democracy,
Kowtowing to Big Money, to Wall Streeters and their cohorts,
To Oil Barons, the Multinational Corporations, the Drone Makers,
To the vast network of contractors for the CIA, NSA, and Homeland Insecurity,
All enjoying secret giveaways for their private pockets
(Estimated at a classified $4+ trillion for the War on Terror),
Big $$$ to the GMO inventors, big Pharma profiting from provisions in “Fast Track” Free Trade Agreements,
To insurance Racketeers serving up sickness under “Obamacare,”
And all their lesser but well rewarded staff of hangers-on,
All thinking that what the 1% want the 90% will get--
The Shaft, not even the Trickle-down.
The Terrorism of War lubricates the Shaft,
The State of National Insecurity shoves it up the ass of any boogeyman foreign terrorist created
And any bold Peacemaker in the Homeland is at risk.
In the Homeland all the agencies of repression mobilize to track the good guy.
Whistle-blowers, dead or alive, by any means necessary!
The NSA passes on what poses as intelligence to the multiplying police agencies.
The FBI infiltrates the peacemakers, tells local cops how to des-occupy the street scat.
Big Brother listens to every word you speak,
And if you don´t think Zombie, puts you on The List.
The Department of War brings official terror instruments to the Homeland,
Arms local police forces with “surplus” military armaments
To provoke and then violently suppress peaceful demonstrators
Protesting police murder and immunity from prosecution.
The State of National Insecurity has more sophisticated apparatuses than Mr. Orwell
Or Adolf Hitler could envision.
So efficient that no Homeland Gestapo is needed--
At least not time yet for domestic Death Squads
Like those created by Ronnie Raygun in Central America in the 1980s
And now the murderous Narco-State in Mexico fashioned by NAFTA and the War on Drugs,
And the neo-Nazi thugs in the Ukraine overthrowing the government
To get Western access to the oil, gas, business opportunity and NATO bases
And start a new Cold War with Russia.
The National Insecurity Agency, a monstrosity almost beyond comprehension,
Scrutinizes billions of private messages of everyone, everywhere,
Abroad the Heads of State of allies are listened to for clues as to their thoughts and policies.
Everywhere searching for intelligence to compile lists of supposed terrorists to kill,
At home compiling lists of millions among the thinking and peaceful,
People like you and me, now with FBI files,
Suspect because we oppose the Terrorism of the Super-Rogue.
We pacifists are potential Terrorists.
The President of nice words and dirty deeds
Says “Reform,” but will as always follow the Dirty Way.
There can be no balance of privacy and security, only cover-ups of what is really going on.
The 2015 “Freedom Act” to limit the NSA is a long way from curtailing surveillance.
The NSA searches for commercial advantage to pass on to Business Cronies.
NSA still spies on friend and foe, sabotages computer systems of “enemies,” like China,
Conspires to facilitate then cloak in secrecy the Official Terrorism of the Super Rogue.
The State of National Insecurity could be considered a fourth branch of government,
The military, security, and police agencies supposedly
Backing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.
Given their centrality, these agencies are better considered
As a State reduced to its all-powerful Repressive Apparatus,
To its authoritarian essence.
Its centrality and power unchecked and not counterbalanced
By executive, legislative, or judicial power.
These branches respond to and do the bidding of the Repressive Apparatus.
The agencies that directly constitute the Repressive Apparatus—
The Department of War, the Joint Chiefs of War Staff,
And the Special Forces created by the military (better termed Death Squads),
The Central Intelligence Assassins, the National Insecurity Agency,
The National Insecurity advisors around the Pres,
Homeland Insecurity, the Injustice Department, the Federal Bureau of Cointelpro,
Local trigger happy police, the National Guard Against Insurgency….
The Senate Insecurity Committee diapers their unwiped asses.
Together these agencies have spawned a vast array of private contracting corporations
That is well beyond the “Military-Industrial Complex” that President Eisenhower warned against.
It is these days not just the big corporations producing weapons,
Now it is private contractors that do much of the dirty counter-terrorism work,
The computer surveillance and sabotage work, the spy work on corporate competitors,
The listening in on allies like the German Chanciler or reformists like the President of Brazil.
Secret mercenary work to disrupt and kill.
The shadow private complex takes in trillions with no oversight or accountability.
The State of National Insecurity is state agencies in symbiosis with a huge complex of private entities
Contracted to share and profit from the Dirty Work.
This Complex, the merging of government agencies and private corporations,
Does the bidding of the entire Plutocracy, united by thirst for war and empire abroad
And social control on the home front.
A government that once had some lawful protections is transformed into a Regime of Repressive Lawlessness
That jails or kills innocents
And accords impunity to the criminality of the agents of the Repressive Apparatus.
The State of National Insecurity corporatizes its global operations,
With no oversight or accountability.
A terror apparatus within the State of National Insecurity.
Subservient to the 1%,
Non-responsive to the courts or Congress.
This State has its homeland, Fortress America;
It has its dogma, the War on Terror;
It has its policy guidelines, Neoliberalism;
It has its ideology to instill in the populace, the religion of Zombyism—
America first, racism, sexism, the War of All Against All,
Imposed cultural ethos of competition and individualism that compliment insecurity and proneness to violence.
Large sectors of the populace are taught to view militarism and violence as a source of pride,
Criticism and resistance are unmanly cowardice, deserving of repressive punishment.
The National State of Insecurity has its creative Think Tanks;
It has its political action groups to spread millions around the electoral landscape;
It has its means of avoiding accountability, a drawn curtain blocking heinous crimes,
A kind of Shari-like code of security and Impunity
A cloak of secrecy so dark only the top criminals who command it know what is going on...
Unlike their counterparts declaring jihad, the bearded Male Islamic Fanatics,
Reacting to the violence perpetrated upon their peoples with their own gross violence,
These Macho Warriors of the Insecurity Complex,
Dress in suits and ties, don’t sport beards, and don’t wave the Bible
When they proclaim “Death to Terrorists”
And at home intimidate the Rabble with teargas and clubs and guns,
Central to the State of National Insecurity is a criminal organization,
A pivot for organizing the ruthless pursuit of the Imperial Vision.
The CIA has a long, long, long history of deadly Interventions and Dirty Tricks.
The torture episode publicized of late is only the shivering tip of a very dense iceberg of Official Terrorism.
After many years of cover-up the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Finally exhibited a semblance of courage in December 2014.
In spite of being spied upon by the insecurity apparatus
The Committee issued a report critical of CIA “enhanced interrogation”
That was central to the War on Terror in the Bush years,
Suspended under Obama in favor of drone attacks and more troops in Afghanistan.
Committee Chairwoman Feinstein termed CIA activity “misguided.”
The President blandly admitted “We tortured some folks.”
The Head of the CIA, unsuccessful in attempts to suppress the report on grounds of “national security”
And former Vice-President Cheney, a principal architect of the war on terror,
An array of those involved,
All rose to defend the indefensible in extensive media coverage,
While not a single victim´s story was aired.
The best that was said in official discourse is that torture is “unfortunate” and occasionally “never again.”
There is immunity for all perpetrators,
The CIA Director and the battery of agents in Covert Operations,
President Bush, VP Cheney, the Attorney General and a battery of lawyers involved,
The Secretary of War, Rumsfeld.
No one will be prosecuted under American or international law
For gross violations of human rights,
For crimes against humanity
Or any other violation of law and international treaties.
No consequences for kidnappings and renditions to Black torture sights,
For indefinite imprisonment in Guantanamo,
For interrogation techniques that included
Rectal feeding (liquefied gourmet Middle Eastern cuisine no doubt)
Rectal hydration (convenient substitute for a water fountain)
Diapers “Generally not to exceed 72 hours” (no latrines, on delayed order from private contractors)
Cramped confinement, stress positions, insect placement, total darkness, sleep deprivation,
Infliction of pain, hunger, and humiliation, threats of rape and execution,
“Walling”, facial hold and slap, and the most notorious--Waterboarding.
Donald Trump asked about reinstating waterboarding said, “You bet your ass.”
These are heinous crimes committed by persons devoid of humanity,
The Gestapo of our era responsible to institutions serving only the most perverse ends.
Lest we forget, American judges in 1946 condemned Nazi torturers to death by hanging.
The only sane response by American citizens is prosecution of those responsible.
Hurrah to Code Pink that attempted to make a citizen´s arrest of Henry Kissinger for his crimes,
The good Ladies were forcibly evited from a Senate Armed Services hearing on Imperial Strategy
And Labeled by Warlord Senator John McCain as “low-life scum”,
No doubt a projection of his own war-mongering character.
For the institution that sponsored these depravities there is only one remedy,
ABOLISH the CIA. Along with the National Security Agency that monitors all of us,
And Homeland Security that that creates long lines at airport,
And ridiculously has us take off our shoes before boarding an airplane.",english,2016-10-26T22:16:26.842+03:00,truth-out.org,US,24453,Why Is It So Hard to Reduce the Pentagon Budget?,0,http://www.truth-out.org/images/Images_2016_10/2016_1025pen_.jpg,37,17,0,0,0,bs

Failure to diversify results in high irony. The Peruvian potato fed millions but caused economic ruin and starvation for the Irish. In Peru, they have 5000 varieties and nobody starves when one goes bad. Ireland had only one genetic species, and that's the point. Had the lazy Spanish stolen a few more varieties from the Incas, there'd have been far and away fewer Irish firemen to put out the Chicago fire. (One's opinion of Chicago notwithstanding.)
While I agree with you, I think the point is the economic model is lazy, it's comfortable profiting with war tools and not paying attention to humanity's real needs or goals. Is war popular with anyone not in office or engaged in the business of making war toys? No. That laziness is the real trouble. They're engaging in pressure and lobbyist campaign contribution bribery for their own benefit, certainly not the innocent public everywhere.

Hillary's jobs plan is to displace American workers and lower their wages. First, Hillary is in favor of increasing the H1B Visas to satisfy her corporate supporters. Secondly, if the TPP passes, foreign corporations can bring in their own workforce and pay them less than an American worker, especially since most make less than $3 an hour. In fact, a foreign corporation can go to arbitration if it feels not enough foreign workers are being let in. Next, we allow about a million new legal immigrants in each year.

Tom Hayden was a crucial figure in the student activist movements of the 1960s and 1970s, known for participating in anti-war protests and demonstrating for civil rights. Notably, he demonstrated against the Vietnam War and was even arrested for his anti-war efforts. Hayden died on Sunday at the age of 76, but even in the last few years he continued to remind America of the importance of activism. 
In a speech given last year at “Vietnam: The Power of Protest,” a conference in Washington, D.C., Hayden cited his activist history and urged Americans not to forget the powerful political movements of earlier decades. “[T]he struggle for memory and for history is a living thing,” he told the audience. “Each generation has to wrestle with the history of what came before, and ask: Whose interest does this history serve? How does it advance a legacy of social movements? How does it deny that legacy?” 
Hayden then began to explain the importance of remembering the widespread political activism of the ’60s and ’70s. “We gather here to remember the power that we had at one point, the power of the peace movement, and to challenge the Pentagon now on the battlefield of memory,” he said. He continued: 
There came a generation of career politicians who were afraid of association with the peace movement, who were afraid of being seen as soft, who saw that the inside track was the track of war. Our national forgetting is basically pathological. Our systems—politics, media, culture—are totally out of balance today because of our collective refusal to admit that the Vietnam War was wrong and that the peace movement was right. In the absence—in the absence of an established voice for peace in all the institutions, the neoconservatives will fill the foreign policy vacuum. Am I right? Will it not? Will it not advise both parties? I think, though, that American public opinion has shifted to a much more skeptical state of mind than earlier generations, but the spectrum of American politics and media has not. 
In order to fully unify, Hayden concluded, America must remember its past. Although he noted the many successes of the anti-war and pro-civil rights movements, he argues that activists must accept that they “all walked away” when the Vietnam War ended. “We might have been united,” Hayden said, “but instead, we were relegated to wondering what might have been.”

( Flickr / CC 2.0 ) 
The “ Podesta emails ” being released by WikiLeaks continue to illuminate concealed aspects of Hillary Clinton’s policy positions. Recent batches of the emails, originating from the server of Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta, include segments of speeches —and a few full transcripts —made by the Democratic presidential nominee to various organizations behind closed doors. 
The emails and speeches are being dumped almost daily and shine a light on many of Clinton’s positions—on the environment, foreign policy, big business, health care and more. An email released Tuesday , however, provides an interesting glimpse into the editing of one of Clinton’s many speeches and focuses on a controversial political issue: the U.S. relationship with Israel and Palestine. 
The email “reveals that an extensive section on Palestinian rights was completely removed from an early draft of the speech” Clinton delivered on Dec. 6, 2015, at the Saban Forum in Washington, reporter Eli Clifton explains : 
Palestinian rights and acknowledgment of their national aspirations are nearly completely lacking from the final version. The speech only made a brief reference to Israeli settlement construction, which Clinton loosely described as a “damaging action.” It also made only one passing, and indirect, acknowledgement of Palestinian suffering, saying, “Israeli children have been killed as have Palestinian children.” … 
A Dec. 4, 2015, version of the speech, apparently drafted by Clinton speechwriter Dan [Schwerin], made specific references to Palestinian suffering and right to self-determination. Although holding to the position of the Democratic Party and the Clinton camp that a two-state solution cannot be imposed by outside actors like the United Nations, this earlier version of the speech explicitly mentioned settlement construction as an impediment to the peace process. 
The Saban Forum “is organized by the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution” and was created and is currently chaired by billionaire Haim Saban, who has a history of pro-Israel policy . Saban is also co-owner of Univision, which recently purchased Gawker Media Group Inc. 
Clifton noted that in another email , Podesta himself suggested a “cut or rework” to a section of the speech that might “evoke how people feel about how Israel is treating the Palestinians,” and Clifton added that Podesta described Saban as “not [being] with [Clinton] if she wasn’t totally committed to Israeli security.” 
Podesta was probably referring to this segment of Schwerin’s draft, which was notably absent from the version Clinton ultimately delivered to the Saban Forum: 
“Israelis cannot live forever in a state of siege. They must not be condemned to the constant fear that they might be stabbed in the street or attacked on a bus. Generation after generation of parents should not have to send their children off to combat. Israelis deserve security, recognition, and a peaceful, normal life. They deserve to live in a nation defined by its founding ideals—democratic, Jewish, and free. 
“And Palestinians have the right to yearn for the freedom to govern themselves, in peace and dignity. For most Americans, it is hard, if not impossible, to imagine living behind checkpoints and roadblocks. Palestinians should be able to achieve their legitimate aspirations. 
“So as difficult as this will be, all the parties must work to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution and create the conditions for progress by avoiding unilateral or damaging actions, whether on the ground, in settlement construction, or at the United Nations.” 
Neither Clinton, Podesta or Schwerin (who is now Clinton’s director of speechwriting ) has commented on the leaked email and speech.",english,2016-10-26T21:32:17.866+03:00,truthdig.com,US,23405,Hillary Clinton’s Private Speech From 2015 Mentioned Palestinian Rights—Until She Actually Gave It,0,http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/ClintonPodestaSabanPalestine_360.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

I was born in Ghazni province of Afghanistan but have no memories of my birthplace. When I was 3, the Taliban took over and forced me and my family to flee the country. I was too little to realize any of this. I still have a blurred image of an old orange bus, a loaf of bread, and rugged, dusty mountains. 
As I grew older, my mother explained that the bus belonged to my father, and we did not attempt to migrate to Iran at first. The Soviet invasion and the Afghan civil war taught people of my village how to protect themselves when crises get heated. The men would move their women and children to the dark, moist undergrounds immediately and make them stay there until the situation calmed down. We were not lucky enough to fit in the underground this time. We passed two days in a mountain—the blurred mountain, in my mind—and hopelessly moved toward Iran. 
My Afghan identity took my precious childhood from me. In Iran, I refrained from playing with other kids since they would mock my Afghan accent. I preferred to stay home to avoid hearing “Afghani kesafat,” or “Afghani Ashghal,” literally meaning “the garbage Afghan,” on the street. 
  
When I turned 7, schools refused to let me attend because I was an undocumented Afghan migrant. I enrolled in a school run by refugees for refugees and did my primary schooling there. But the school lacked human and capital resources to offer classes beyond seventh grade, and an undocumented Afghan refugee could not get any further education. Constant insults, seclusion and deprivation of the right to a quality education were the gifts Iran provided me in my childhood. 
In 2001, upon the fall of the Taliban regime, my family and I returned to Afghanistan. At first glance, Kabul resembled anything but a city. Crumbled walls, broken glass, burned buildings, dusty roads and bullet shells on the streets all were evidence of the war. We did not expect a war-weary city to be any better. Yet one thing lured us into returning: safety and the hope for a better future. The Joint Way Forward deal between the European Union and Afghanistan misses this crucial point. 
In early October, the Afghan government and the EU signed this bilateral deal, which facilitates deportation of thousands of Afghan asylum seekers. In return, the EU promised to continue its generous aid package to Afghanistan. The deal promises job creation for returnees, emphasizes reintegration and resettlement programs, and ensures the safe return of vulnerable groups, in particular unaccompanied minors and women. 
None of these factors are enough to prevent hundreds of thousands of Afghans from taking the perilous journey toward Europe without a guarantee of security. After the fall of the Taliban, thousands of Afghan families returned to the war-torn country despite being aware of the existing limited opportunities. 
Peace, hope for the future and stability were the factors which drove Afghans back to their homeland for the first time since 2001. The irony is that the lack of these very notions in 2015 made thousands of others abandon the country. With more than 11,000 civilian casualties, 2015 is the worst year in terms of security since the fall of the Taliban. 
The Joint Way Forward is based on the illusion that Afghanistan is safe. Kunduz, one of the country’s major cities, fell into the hands of the Taliban for the second time this year. The war forced hundreds to flee the city, while hundreds of others remained defenseless and stuck. 
In Badghis, a northwestern province, at least 60 police officers surrendered to the Taliban with their guns and resources. Three districts of Farah, a western province, already are ruled by insurgents. The Taliban rules many districts of Helmand province, and active war goes on in the city every so often. 
Nengarhar, Paktia, Paktika, Ghazni, and most other provinces are no better. Even the shortest highways—such as the Kabul-Ghazni, or Kabul-Wardak, routes—are controlled by the Taliban. Unknown numbers of people are being kidnapped or killed based on ethnic and religious reasons, or for having ties with foreign or government officials, on a regular basis. 
At least three bombs have exploded in different areas of Kabul since the deal was signed. By considering Afghanistan safe, despite the ongoing turmoil, the EU flinches from its humanitarian responsibility. 
Afghans have fled uncertainty, insecurity and the abusive policies of their government with the hopes of establishing a better life for themselves in Europe. They never imagined they would risk their entire lives to be sold back to the government they just escaped. More than a mere failure of security in Afghanistan, the EU-Afghan deal is a failure of humanity. 
Most EU countries warn their citizens against travelling to Afghanistan and mark it unsafe on their Foreign Affairs website. If it is not safe for EU citizens to spend a few days in Afghanistan, how is it safe for Afghans to live their whole lives there? Such deals reinforce double standards and spotlight how differently people’s lives are valued in today’s world. 
Europe’s decision to deport Afghans is hasty, unconstructive and shortsighted. People’s lives are being endangered for a second time. Statistics show that a great number of previous deportees already have attempted to return to Europe through Balkan routes. Many others lack social support to stay in Afghanistan after migrating to Europe from Pakistan or Iran. 
The deal is also unproductive for Europe, since it could lead to a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis. 
The current bilateral EU-Afghan deal will be a colossal failure unless the EU forces the Afghan government to prioritize security. Dealing with corruption and regaining people’s trust is the next big move to push people back to their homeland. 
The developed world should not use aid as a negotiating tool to pressurize poorer nations. 
People’s lives are not political capital.

Editor’s Note: Tom Hayden, an activist, author and longtime Truthdig contributor , died Sunday at age 76. In his memory, Truthdig will share one of Hayden’s pieces each day this week. This story was originally posted on April 9, 2006. *** 
Author and political activist Tom Hayden speaks at length about his politics, the war in Iraq, Cuba-U.S. relations and a range of other topics with Cuban journalists in an interview for Juventud Rebelde . The English translation of the interview is published here in full, courtesy of Hayden. 
During the past five years, the American people have seen vivid pictures of American soldiers torturing prisoners. We now have evidence that the Bush administration is engaged in a massive domestic surveillance program, without judicial or congressional approval, that targets American citizens. President Bush ordered American soldiers to war over nonexistent weapons of mass destruction. The Bush administration and FEMA failed the people of New Orleans during the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Can you explain why the Bush administration seems immune from the political fallout that ordinarily results from such scandals? Why is there is no serious move to impeach the president for any or all of these scandals? 
Advertisement Square, Site wide 
I do not wish to sound like an apologist, but the Bush administration is not immune. Legally, the cases against Libby and Abramoff and DeLay are slow-moving bad news for Bush. Politically, the Bush poll ratings are below the 40% range. Republican candidates for Congress are in trouble even though their congressional districts are designed to protect their power. As to impeachment, something like half of Americans favor impeachment or censure. If the Democrats win back the House this November, Rep. John Conyers will chair the Judiciary Committee and introduce impeachment. In general, American politics is still suffering from the stolen election of 2000, the chilling effects of 9/11, and the fabricated and unjustified invasion of iraq. Can you explain why the level of protests in the U.S. against the war in Iraq is not as notable as during the war in Vietnam? 
The difference is that during Vietnam there was a military draft and the number of casualties was far, far higher. Relatively speaking, therefore, the level of protests today is greater—200,000 in October 2002 in D.C.; 1 million in February 2003; 500,000 in New York in 2004; 300,000 in D.C. in 2005. The reformist presidential campaign of Howard Dean was larger than the antiwar Eugene McCarthy campaign of 1968. A majority of Americans, including a majority of U.S. soldiers, want a troop withdrawal within this year. The “notable” difference, I believe, is that there was a broader radical movement around the world, certainly in 1968, than there is today. That makes the antiwar movement, here and globally, a surprising development, it seems to me. Do you envision an exit strategy for the U.S. in Iraq in the foreseeable future? 
There is an exit strategy available, with some support even within the Pentagon, but it is unlikely that Bush will adopt it. The strategy would consist of a U.S. announcement of withdrawal, a cease-fire by the Iraqi resistance during the withdrawal, an international peacekeeping force composed of countries not involved in the occupation, a transitional coalition in Baghdad, new elections under international auspices, a peacetime reconstruction, and reparations from the U.S. And UK. 
Bush may, and I emphasize may, begin withdrawing tens of thousands of U.S. troops this year in order to pacify antiwar sentiment, neutralize Democrats and keep control of the House of Representatives. One faction in the Pentagon calls this the “Philippines option”—have your client government invite you to withdraw, so that it is perceived as a “victory.” Recent trends in Latin America make it appear that it is no longer an American backyard. Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Uruguay are some of the countries that are taking an independent path to political and economic development. It would appear that with the expected election of Lopez Obrador, Mexico may soon join that list. What can we expect from the Bush administration with respect to Latin America in the coming months? 
I have traveled extensively in Latin America since 2000, and it is a place of exciting and dramatic developments, as you know. I think progressives across our boundaries should propose a new U.S. Latin American policy “beyond the Monroe Doctrine.” We in the U.S. also must invigorate solidarity movements like those towards Central America and Cuba in past decades. It is a dangerous period because of the Bush administration. Towards Cuba, their malign intentions are well known. Towards Venezuela, they are defining a new security threat of “radical populism,” and seeking ways to destabilize the democratically elected government. Even assassination of Hugo Chavez is an option that some are considering. On the trade front, the Bush team will try to divide Latin American countries through bilateral trade agreements. In the Andes, they will continue to send U.S. troops under the cover of the war on drugs. We note that you have always been an enemy of the so-called Free Trade Agreement that was so soundly defeated at the presidential summit in Argentina. Is that agreement dead and buried? Can you comment on the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas, known as ALBA? 
Latin America, along with U.S. social movements, has defeated the so-called Free Trade Agreement of the Americas for the foreseeable future. The World Trade Organization [WTO] is far from defeated, partly because of internal differences among Latin American countries. I believe the Bolivarian Alternative is an extremely important counterforce against the U.S. imperial design. Mercosur also is a welcome development. A united front among the new nationalist governments of Latin America is to be hoped for. Venezuela has recently been supplying heating oil at low cost for lower-income people in certain U.S. cities, yet some Republican congressmen have been critical of this gesture. Please comment. 
In general, the response to the Venezuelan initiative has been positive or neutral. Objections by some members of Congress is to be expected, because they want to prevent any U.S. acceptance of the Chavez government. The man many call the Osama bin Laden of Latin America, Luis Posada Carriles, is in the United States. He is wanted in Venezuela for 73 counts of first-degree murder in the downing of a civilian passenger plane in 1976, yet the Bush administration refuses to send him to Venezuela. How does that square with President Bushs so-called war on terror? 
Of course it is a contradiction. Unfortunately, there is little media attention to the issue up here. But the issue is a definite complication for the Bush administration’s efforts to improve its status in Latin America. 
You were one of the Chicago 7 that Leonard Weinglass defended in 1968. Now Mr. Weinglass is one of the lead lawyers in the case of the Cuban Five. Do you think that anyone sympathetic to the Cuban revolution can get a fair trial in Miami? 
I have read the materials concerning the case, and believe it is a great untold story here. Of course, Leonard Weinglass is one of our greatest defense lawyers and is working constantly to generate political and media interest in the Cuban Five. No, a Cuban revolutionary cannot get a fair trial in Miami. But I believe the grip of the anti-Castro Cubans over Latin American policy has been weakened severely by events in Latin America and the recent growth of a vast Latino and immigrant movement in the United States. The Bush administration recently tightened travel restrictions for Americans wishing to travel to Cuba. Do Americans have a constitutional right to travel? 
They always have and always will. Bush is imposing a frustration on all of us, apparently to placate his Cuban allies in Miami. How will history judge the Bush administration? How does President Bush compare to other U.S. presidents in recent history? 
Who knows, but I think Bush will be marked with illegitimacy for the stolen election of 2000, fabrication and failure in Iraq, corruption and unconstitutional spying at home. Perhaps he will face impeachment, perhaps not. Certainly he is going through his Watergate moment today. It is important to speak of the system, however, not simply Bush. Since the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the U.S. has attempted to be the sole superpower in a so-called unipolar world. But its efforts towards military and economic empire have faltered and will be, in a sense, re-negotiated. As Hugo Chavez and others have argued, the reality is that we live in a multipolar world. The combination of massive social movements and the multipolarity of power will prevail over any forces seeking to dominate. As they say, another world is not only possible but is already being created. 
The United States cannot succeed with superpower tactics even on the baseball field. 
I know the horrors of U.S. imperialism in Latin America, but I hope that Latin American nationalists will welcome and reach out to the “American people,” especially those in social movements and independent media but also those in political and economic sectors who have no interest in blockades, subversion, assassination or economic dominance. We are here, and our numbers are growing, especially because of the immigrants who are the “harvest of empire” [in the words of Juan Gonzales]. Those who live in the imperial center cannot be expected to “come to power” any time soon, but can restrain and complicate aggression and forge new policies which have the support of a majority of the U.S. people—out of Iraq, support for energy alternatives, funding for Katrina victims instead of war, civil liberties instead of secret tribunals and policing, no intervention in Venezuela, lifting the blockade on Cuba, and so forth. Strong support for such measures not only makes imperialism more difficult to sustain, but lays the basis for a broad center-left alternative which actually can succeed in the U.S. in the years ahead. It has nearly happened here before, in the 1930s and ‘40s before the Cold War, and again in the 1960s. Such moments will come again.

As is to be expected, if not applauded, the closer we get to the Nov. 8 election, the more debates and divisions have appeared in discussions about the headlines of the moment. 
During the week that ranged from Oct. 16-23, those headlines included additional revelations from WikiLeaks’ trove of Pedesta emails regarding Hillary Clinton’s campaign, as well as various writers’ takes on how to vote this time around, and news of the ongoing Dakota Access pipeline protest. 
As for the how-to-vote issue, Jonathan Mitchell posted a short and direct comment under this story about Clinton’s famous hawkishness when it comes to envisioning and enacting American foreign policy on the world stage: 

Reader Helen Hanna, like many others who took in Robert Reich’s piece titled “The Incalculable Damage of Doing Whatever It Takes to Win,” noticed and remarked upon Reich’s gloss-over of Democratic Party leaders’, and in particular Hillary and Bill Clinton’s, proclivity for doing damage in the interest of maintaining power: 

That said, it’s not as though commenters were about to give Donald Trump a pass, either. Take Ignatius J. Reilly’s rejoinder to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway’s “5-point plan to defeat Islam,” as Trump and his team conceived of it (and Juan Cole wrote of it): 

Touché. 
Another point of contention on the comment boards last week had to do with how to evaluate WikiLeaks’, and by extension Julian Assange’s, latest release of documents in the Pedesta emails. Though some commentators like Naomi Klein and Glenn Greenwald have spoken up about particular aspects of WikiLeaks’ current m.o., in the thread under Alexander Reed Kelly’s Truthdigger of the Week column on Assange , reader JJG noted how, like him or not, Assange and his organization are providing a public service that professionals working in the mainstream press (who are supposed to be skilled in curating and redacting sensitive material) are not generally delivering on these days: 

We’ll give Opa Westphal the last word this time, ending on an up note (in terms of the shout-out to other commenters) and a cautionary note at the same time. This one was posted under Chris Hedges’ latest column , “How Power Works”:",english,2016-10-26T23:45:45.259+03:00,truthdig.com,US,23405,Comments of the Week: Here Comes Trouble,0,http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/22294194410_c4f53ec0c8_z_copy.jpg,0,0,0,0,0,bs

HOUSTON, TX – Chambers County election officials have switched to emergency paper ballots after technical glitches with the electronic voting machines during early voting. Chambers County Clerk, Heather Hawthorne said electronic voting will be temporarily suspended until her office completes a software update. Reportedly, there was an error in the programming of Election Systems and Software, Inc. electronic voting machines. “The Straight Party vote for both the Republicans and Democrats did not automatically select one race on each ballot.” Hawthorne said she anticipates all technical difficulties to be addressed by the end of Tuesday. But until the issue is fully corrected, emergency paper ballots will be used.

By Peter Koenig on October 26, 2016 The penultimate goal is total militarization of the western world, to prevent and suppress protests and revolts . 
by Peter Koenig 
False flagging has hundreds of years of history; successful history that is, otherwise the method of lying and bullying people into false beliefs, that would not have survived the times. 
But false flags took on a new dimension since 9/11. The subsequent terror acts, including the Arab Spring and ‘Color Revolutions’; downing of a Russian plane over Egypt; shooting down of a Malaysian plane over the Ukraine; Paris murderous shootings at ‘Charlie Hebdo’ and ‘Bataclan’; Brussels; Nice; Munich; Orlando, Florida; San Bernardino, California – to name just a few over the last years – were perpetrated by the very actors claiming to fight terror, namely predominantly the secret services of the US, UK and Israel, the European vassals and NATO. The purpose of such acts of terror is to create fear, to justify a police crackdown on the populations and each time doing away with more of the democratic civil rights still left in western society. 
The penultimate goal is total militarization of the western world, to prevent and suppress protests and revolts if and when the population eventually wakes up to the flagrant lies that it has been force-fed by the presstitute media for years on end. 
And that in itself is a crucial step towards the ultimate goal of Full Spectrum Dominance of the world, or world hegemony, by a small corporate and financial elite. Alas, militarization of the west and ongoing wars and chaos throughout the world, causing millions of death – estimated between 12 and 15 million in the last 15 years – will not suffice to dominate the eastern powers led by Russia and China. Do the elites who pull the strings in Washington want a nuclear war? It may fulfill their pathological objective of total annihilation of the world as we know it, possibly with hundreds of millions of casualties. Just look at Aleppo and multiply this image by a million. See also Kissinger’s 1974 Plan for Food Control Genocide. https://www.schillerinstitute.org/food_for_peace/kiss_nssm_jb_1995.html . Emails expose close ties between Hillary Clinton and former Secretary of State and accused war criminal Henry Kissinger. Is reduction of world population by any means a major objective: Kissinger’s 1974 ‘study’ on famine as genocide, was commissioned in full connivance with Monsanto and the GMO technology – a food war, the preparation of which is ongoing as the world is facing a nuclear threat. 
Intensified through four decades of Cold War, the US has grown increasingly dependent on the military – security industry for its economic advances. Creating weapons to exploit and destroy in foreign lands what later needs reconstruction is an easy way to making huge profits, sustaining an otherwise outsourced production economy and an ever poorer local population that lives off imported junk. 
This is true for the misinformed US and European public. The West is sinking by its own inaction into a deep hole. 
However, the need for more sophisticated weaponry and more destruction is spiraling exponentially, as greed, avarice and power know no limits. A WWIII scenario is becoming an imminent danger.   wars 
Do the neocon architects of US foreign policy hope to survive a nuclear inferno in their lush bunkers? The western presstitute media portrays the US as fighting in the Middle East and elsewhere ‘humanitarian wars’ to stamp out terrorism and other atrocities committed by the new Killary anointed Axis of Evil, Russia-Iran-Syria, and by association, China. The basic premise is, they are the “good guys” and the Russians under Putin’s orders are constantly interfering with America’s humanitarian deeds. This sick understanding, continuously touted by the western media controlled by the six Zionist-Anglo media giants, and repeated hourly, will make massive, credible false-flagging like a walk in the park – a walk in which about a billion ‘westerners’ are cheering for war against the eastern evil. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for war with Russia 
Currently the US is secretly on DEFCON level 3 warning against a Russian nuclear attack (DEFCON = Defense Readiness Condition) . The American public doesn’t know it. – Level 3 means an attack could be days away; level one would imply an imminent attack within less than an hour. 
This in itself is a false flag, a make-believe that a first strike may come from Russia, when the Pentagon hawks openly boast that a first preventive strike is not off the table. Some high level generals even push for it. 
There is a massive orchestrated build-up of potential false flags around the globe that would allow a first strike nuclear attack on several fronts against Russia, Syria, Iran and China, by the US armed forces, NATO and the European vassals’ own armies. Israel is poised to launch an attack against Iran. 
Syria – the 20-nation Peace Talks of Saturday 15 October 2016 in Lausanne, Switzerland, focusing on an Aleppo cease fire, predictably failed to produce any tangible results. Nevertheless, in a real humanitarian effort, Russia has declared an 8-hour truce to begin on Thursday, 20 October, “We have taken a decision not to waste time and to introduce ‘humanitarian pauses’, mainly for the free passage of civilians, evacuation of the sick and wounded and withdrawal of fighters. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoi, chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces 
The ceasefire would run from 0800 to 1600 local time (0500 GMT to 1300 GMT) “in the area of Aleppo. During this period the Russian air force and Syrian government troops will halt air strikes and firing from any other types of weapons,” as ‘vanguardngr.com’ quoted senior Russian military officer Sergei Rudskoi as saying at a press briefing. – Later the truce has been extended to 11 hours and at yesterday’s (19 October) ‘peace discussion’ in Berlin, hosted by Madame Merkel, Mr. Putin said he would be prepared to extend it to 3 days, if all the parties were committed to observe it. 
What if – in defiance of this mini-ceasefire – US, US-proxies, or NATO fighters keep bombing Syrian army ground troops in the Aleppo region, as well as hospitals and civilian populations, to encourage Al-Nusra, cum IS terrorists to stay their course and keep sowing misery and killing civilians? – Russia has warned Washington that any attack on Assad’s troops would be the object of retaliation. Might such a scenario be a provocation to start a hot WWIII? – Precedents of defying cease fire agreements and blaming Russia for it exist in the not so distant past: 17 September, when the US air force ‘by mistake’ attacked Assad’s ground forces killing 62 soldiers – and who knows how many civilians – then, through the complicit MSM blamed Russia for it. US attack on Syrian troops not an accident, definitely intentional – Assad to AP 
It is not inconceivable that US war planes painted to look like Russians, could attack their own Air Force in Syria or Iraq, blaming Russia, thereby triggering a US first strike. 
With the brainwashed western population, the false flag would be an easy sell as a Russian aggression, justifying Washington’s ‘first strike’. 
America’s indefectible British ally has recently given its fighter jet pilots ‘permission’ to fire on Russian aircraft in Syria. – What if they actually do so, as a US proxy? – And Russia retaliates against a NATO country – which is according to NATO rules an aggression against all NATO. This could mean an all-out war. US and NATO bases in Europe would not be spared. By now there are 24 bases, an increase from 14 since 1991, when the West promised not to expand NATO. This would plunge Europe for the third time in 100 years into – this time an all-annihilating – war scenario. How can Europe not see and understand this? 
Yemen – Since March 2015 a Saudi led coalition, for which until recently Washington provided weapons, logistical and intelligence support, is bombing the Houthi rebels. The Houtis, fighting for freedom from the western domination, have seized the Presidential Palace in Sana’a, sending the despotic US puppet President Hadi to Saudi Arabia into exile. The Houthis enjoy the backing of the majority of the Yemeni population and are considered the legitimate government. They also receive logistics support from Iran. They control about a quarter of the Yemeni landmass but more than three quarters of the population. The Saudis have been cowardly targeting mostly civilian populations, family celebrations, like weddings and funerals, humanitarian food and medical supplies and hospitals, slaughtering tens of thousands of mainly women and children. A couple of weeks ago the US and UK Air Forces have joined the Saudis in this atrocious war. The Geo-Political Nature of the Strait of Hormuz 
While the Houthis have called on President Putin for help, the US has now called, through the UN, for a 72-hour ceasefire to enter into effect on 19 October mid-night. The official purpose is ‘humanitarian aid’, but the real reason is for the alliance of aggressors to regroup and strategize. It is inconceivable that the Master of Chaos would let go of such an optimal strategically placed country, overlooking the Gulf of Oman and the Iran controlled Strait of Hormuz, through which currently about 25 % of the world’s hydrocarbons sail. A western planted false flag, depicting a Russian intervention, could easily activate a full-scale war. 
Israel, entering friendly relations with the Saudis, has asked the House of Saud for access to Saudi airfields which they may use to launch a ‘preemptive’ attack against Iran. 
Internet spying and cyber war accusations against President Putin – most ridiculous, but with sledgehammer propaganda the American and most of European population will gulp this lie as the truth – and encourage US, UK and Israeli secret services (the infamous trio) to do likewise. 
The argument is that Mr. Putin wants to derail US elections in favor of Donald Trump and hacking into DNC computers to divulge Democratic party corruption scandals – laying bare Madame Clinton’s corruption and lies. Apparently the CIA has already declared a cyber war against President Putin. 
Russia could potentially retaliate, jamming key US strategic war systems with DRFM (Digital Radio Frequency Memory) technology, already successfully applied in 2015 in Syria, near Latakia, disrupting all US-NATO Radar and Satellites Communication systems. – Might such a possible retaliation and escalation in cyber warfare be translated into a lethal aggression by Russia, justifying a full-out war, with nuclear consequences? 
On 19 October, Presidents Putin, Hollande and Poroshenko traveled to Berlin at the invitation of Madame Merkel to discuss Syria and implementation of a peace plan for eastern Ukraine. First, how come, a sovereign country like Syria is discussed by foreign powers, without – and I mean without any representation of Mr. Assad’s government? It is a human and diplomatic aberration. But what else would we expect from the west. Still, people need to be reminded that what appears normal is NOT normal at all. 
The little that emerged from the meeting is that Mr. Hollande went home frustrated since Mr. Putin did not stand up to ‘his responsibilities in Ukraine’- what a flagrant lie! And Hollande knows it! – A lso was disclosed that no real agreement was reached on how to go about achieving peace in Syria. Putin answering questions regarding ISIS from a US journalist 
Obviously for the western stooges of Washington, present in Berlin, there is only one way a ‘solution’ could be found: ‘Regime Change’. They will not let go. Even though Hollande and Merkel know absolutely well, why the US instigated the war in Syria, by recruiting and preparing, arming and funding terror groups already in 2007 (look for ‘Syria’ in this article 
http://www.globalresearch.ca/its-not-just-the-oil-the-middle-east-war-and-the-conquest-of-natural-gas-reserves/5307589 
On Ukraine – Poroshenko has promised a new road map for peace, nothing more exciting. The practical deadlock on Syria and ‘no news’ on Ukraine was to be expected. It is of course being blamed by both Hollande and Merkel on Vladimir Putin, who has never played a role in either conflict, both of them are the result of the evil fist of Washington. 
Mr. Putin entered Syria only at the demand of Mr. Assad, to defend and rid the country of western implanted terrorists. He is also doing everything possible to pacify Ukraine, to no avail. 
The west doesn’t want peace, but they want to blame Russia for the conflicts. Failure of the Merkel meeting might possibly be followed by a false flag against Kiev or Aleppo, to be put on Putin’s account, what else. Remember, the US Air Force has jets painted as Russian jets. 
China 
Would a US provocation on the Chinese controlled Spratly Islands, or an infringement on China’s air and land space, as there have been many in the past, become a trigger for engaging China in a nuclear aggression? South China sea 
Hot spots around the world devastated to chaos by the empire abound. Anyone of them is a potential launch path for an atomic mushroom. Should this happen before the upcoming US elections, Obama might just stay on for another term. He has all the experience it needs to create more chaos and more division to conquer than any of his predecessors. He is also an obedient servant to those that pull the strings and watch through the eye on top of the pyramid, so clearly depicted in the US dollar bill, the symbol for Zionist-Freemason total hegemony. But importantly, he, like Hillary, would most likely not hesitate to push the Red Bottom, when asked to do so by their masters.

By Cristiano Lima 
Hillary Clinton slammed the California National Guard and Pentagon on Monday for reportedly demanding soldiers who fought in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan a decade ago to return enlistment bonuses they received for their service. 
“I am appalled that National Guard officials are attempting to recoup money from soldiers who accepted bonuses a decade ago,” the Democratic nominee said in a statement released Monday night in response to the reports, which first appeared in the Los Angeles Times. 
“These troops deserve our support and our deepest gratitude; they served admirably and upheld their part of the bargain,” she said. “It is unacceptable to now subject them and their families to undue financial burdens thanks to to mismanagement from the California National Guard and rigid bureaucracy on the part of the Pentagon.”

For years, state and federal policymakers have discussed proposals to expand the role of advanced practice registered nurses, with major physician groups like the American Medical Association squaring off against nurse organizations like the American Nurses Association. 
But a proposed rule from the Department of Veterans Affairs to allow nurse practitioners, nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists to practice independently of physicians has brought the debate to the national spotlight and sparked an unprecedented response from the public. 
“To use advanced practice registered nurses to their full authority, it improves access and enables the delivery of high-quality care, and that’s good for everybody,” Marla Weston, CEO of the American Nurses Association, told The Daily Signal. “It’s good for the health care system, and it’s good for people in all sorts of ways.”

Hillary Clinton hat gerade erklärt, dass die Wahl sich nicht um Programme dreht, sondern um die Frage: ""Wer sind die Amerikaner? Die republikanischen Führer entziehen ihrem Kandidaten, Donald Trump, nicht wegen politischen Themen ihre Unterstützung, sondern wegen seinem persönlichen Verhalten. Unserem Autor zufolge waren die Amerikaner bisher aus unterschiedlichen Gegenden kommende Einwanderer, die akzeptierten, sich der Ideologie einer bestimmten Gemeinschaft unterzuordnen. Das ist dieses Modell, das jetzt allmählich zerfällt, mit der Gefahr das Land selbst zunichte zu machen.
Voltaire Netzwerk | Damaskus (Syrien) | 26. Oktober 2016 français Español italiano русский English Português ελληνικά Türkçe عربي 73% der millenaristischen Wähler (d.h. jene die an das baldige Ende der Welt glauben) weisen den republikanischen Kandidaten Trump zurück. 68% von ihnen halten die demokratische Kandidatin für fähiger, um die Mittelklasse zu verteidigen; 64% halten sie für besser in aussenpolitischen Fragen; 61% in ökonomischen Fragen. Während des Jahres der amerikanischen Wahl-Kampagne, die wir mitgemacht haben, hat sich die Rhetorik tiefgreifend verändert und zwischen den beiden Lagern ist eine unerwartete Spaltung aufgetaucht. Wenn anfangs die Kandidaten über wirkliche politische Themen sprachen (z. B. die Verteilung des Reichtums oder die nationale Sicherheit), geht es jetzt hauptsächlich um Sex und Geld.
Es ist diese Rede und nicht die politischen Fragen, die die republikanische Partei gesprengt hat - deren Hauptführer ihrem Kandidaten die Unterstützung entzogen - und die das politische Schachbrett neugestaltet hat, indem sie eine sehr alte zivilisatorische Kluft wieder auftauchen ließen. Auf der einen Seite will Frau Clinton politisch korrekt erscheinen, während auf der anderen Seite der ""Donald"" die Heuchelei der ehemaligen ""First Lady"" in Stücke reißt.
Auf der einen Seite fördert Hillary Clinton die Gleichberechtigung von Mann und Frau, obwohl sie nie gezögert hatte, Frauen, die wissen ließen mit ihrem Ehemann Sex gehabt zu haben, anzugreifen und zu beschmutzen; obwohl sie nicht für ihre persönlichen Qualitäten Kandidatin ist, sondern als Ehefrau des ehemaligen Präsidenten, und Donald Trump der Frauenfeindlichkeit beschuldigt, weil er aus seiner Vorliebe für Frauen keinen Hehl macht. Auf der anderen Seite prangert Donald Trump die Privatisierung des Staates an, die Erpresserbande von ausländischen Persönlichkeiten durch die Clinton-Stiftung, um einen Termin im Außenministerium zu bekommen; die Schaffung von ObamaCare, die nicht im Interesse der Bürger, sondern nur der Krankenversicherung ist; und er geht selbst so weit, um die Aufrichtigkeit des Wahlsystems in Frage zu stellen.
Ich weiß sehr wohl, dass die Ausdrucksweise von Donald Trump in der Tat Rassismus fördert, aber ich denke nicht, dass dies das Herzstück der Wahldebatte ist, trotz der von den Pro-Clinton Medien gemachten Hype.
Es ist nicht gleichgültig, dass während der Lewinsky-Affäre, Präsident Bill Clinton sich bei der Nation entschuldigt und Pastoren versammelt hat, um für seine Rettung zu beten. Während Donald Trump, für ähnliches Verhalten mit einer Audio-Aufnahme in Frage gestellt, sich nur bei den verletzten Personen entschuldigte, ohne Mitglieder des Klerus miteinzubeziehen.
Die aktuelle Spaltung greift die Revolte der Werte der Katholiken, Orthodoxen und Lutheraner gegen die Calvinisten wieder auf, die in den Vereinigten Staaten vor allem durch die Presbyterianer, Baptisten und Methodisten vertreten sind.
Wenn die beiden Kandidaten auch in puritanischer Tradition (Clinton als Methodistin und Trump als Presbyterianer) erzogen wurden, kehrte Frau Clinton erst nach dem Tod ihres Vaters zur Religion zurück und beteiligt sich heute an der Gebetsgruppe des Stabschefs der Streitkräfte, the family, während Herr Trump eine mehr innerliche Spiritualität ausübt und selten in den Tempel geht.
Natürlich ist niemand in seinem Muster eingesperrt, in dem er aufgewachsen ist. Aber wenn wir ohne zu denken handeln, reproduzieren wir es ohne dessen bewusst zu sein. Die Frage des religiösen Umfeldes kann also für jedermann wichtig sein.
Um zu verstehen, worum es geht, muss man ins England des 17. Jahrhunderts zurückgehen. Oliver Cromwell stürzte König Charles I. mit einem militärischen Staatsstreich. Er behauptete, eine Republik zu etablieren, die Seele des Landes zu reinigen und ließ den ehemaligen Souveränen enthaupten. Er schuf ein sektiererisches Regime, inspiriert von den Ideen von Calvin, massakrierte massenweise die irischen Papisten und verhängte einen puritanischen Lebensstil. Er entwarf auch den Zionismus: Er rief die Juden nach England zurück und war das erste Staatsoberhaupt der Welt, das die Schaffung eines jüdischen Staates in Palästina befürwortete. Diese blutige Episode ist als der ""erste britische Bürgerkrieg"" bekannt.
Nach der Restauration der Monarchie flohen Cromwells Puritaner aus England. Sie ließen sich in den Niederlanden nieder, von wo manche von ihnen auf der Mayflower nach Amerika (die ""Pilger"") fuhren, während andere die Gemeinschaft der Afrikaneer im südlichen Afrika gründeten. Während des Unabhängigkeitskrieges der Vereinigten Staaten im 18. Jahrhundert erlebte man wieder die Konfrontation der Calvinisten gegen die britische Monarchie, die man in den derzeitigen britischen Geschichtsbüchern als ""zweiten Bürgerkrieg"" bezeichnet.
Im 19. Jahrhundert fand der Sezessionskrieg statt zwischen den Staaten des Südens (hauptsächlich von katholischen Siedlern bewohnt) und den des Norden (eher von protestantischen Siedlern bewohnt). Die Geschichte der Gewinner stellt diese Auseinandersetzung als einen Kampf für die Freiheit von der Sklaverei dar, was reine Propaganda ist (die südlichen Staaten schafften die Sklaverei während des Krieges ab, als sie ein Bündnis mit der britischen Monarchie schlossen). In der Tat war die Konfrontation jene der Puritaner mit dem englischen Thron, Grund, dass einige Historiker hier über den ""Dritten britischen Bürgerkrieg“ sprechen.
Während des zwanzigsten Jahrhunderts schien dieser innere Kampf der britischen Zivilisation überholt, außer dem Wiederaufleben der Puritaner im Vereinigten Königreich mit den ""nicht-konformen Christen"" von Premierminister David Lloyd George. Letztere teilten Irland und versprachen eine ""jüdische nationale Heimstätte"" in Palästina zu schaffen.
Wie auch immer, einer der Berater von Richard Nixon, Kevin Phillips, hat diesen Bürgerkriegen eine voluminöse Arbeit gewidmet und festgestellt, dass keines der Probleme gelöst war und hat eine vierte Runde angekündigt [ 1 ].
Die Anhänger der reformierten calvinistischen Kirchen, seit 40 Jahren mit überwältigender Mehrheit Wähler für die Republikaner, unterstützen von nun an die Demokraten.
Ich habe keinen Zweifel, dass Frau Clinton der nächste Präsident der Vereinigten Staaten werden wird, oder, dass wenn Herr Trump gewählt wurde, er schnell beseitigt werden würde. Aber in wenigen Monaten gab es eine breite Wahl-Umverteilung auf einem Hintergrund des demografischen irreversiblen Wandels. Die Puritaner Kirchen bedeuten insgesamt nur mehr ein Viertel der Bevölkerung und fallen in das demokratische Lager. Ihr Modell erscheint als ein historischer Unfall. Es verschwand in Südafrika und wird nicht viel länger überleben, weder in den USA noch in Israel.
Jenseits der Präsidentschaftswahl muss sich die US-Gesellschaft schnell entwickeln oder wird sich wieder zerreißen. In einem Land, wo die Jugend massiv den Einfluss der puritanischen Prediger ablehnt, ist es nicht möglich, das Thema der Gleichstellung aufzuschieben. Die Puritaner erwägen eine Gesellschaft, wo alle Menschen gleich sind, aber nicht gleichwertig. Lord Cromwell wollte eine Republik für die Engländer, aber erst, nachdem er die irischen Papisten niedergemacht hatte. Es sind derzeit in den Vereinigten Staaten alle Bürger vor dem Gesetz gleich, aber im Namen der gleichen Texte verurteilen die Gerichte systematisch Schwarze, während sie für Weiße, die entsprechende Straftaten begangen haben, mildernde Umstände finden. Und in der Mehrzahl der Staaten genügt eine strafrechtliche Verurteilung, ja selbst ein Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitung, um das Wahlrecht zu verlieren. Infolgedessen sind schwarz und weiß gleich, aber in einigen Bundesstaaten hat die Mehrheit der schwarzen Männer ihr Wahlrecht verloren. Das Paradigma von diesem Gedanken in der Außenpolitik, ist die ""zwei-Staaten-Lösung"" in Palästina: gleich, aber vor allem nicht gleichwertig.
Das ist das puritanische Denken, das die Verwaltungen des Pastors Carter, von Reagan, von Bush (Senior und Junior sind zwei direkte Nachfahren der Pilgerväter), von Clinton und Obama dazu führte, den Wahhabismus zu unterstützen, im Widerspruch mit den Idealen ihres Landes und heute selbst Daesch zu unterstützen.
Einst gründeten die Pilgerväter Gemeinschaften in Plymouth und Boston, die im kollektiven amerikanischen Gedächtnis idealisiert wurden. Die Historiker sind sich jedoch einig, sie sagten, das ""neue Israel"" zu bilden und wählten das ""Gesetz von Moses"". Sie setzten kein Kreuz in ihre Tempel, sondern die Tafeln des Gesetzes. Obwohl Christen, legen sie mehr Wert auf die jüdischen Schriften als auf die Evangelien. Sie zwangen ihre Frauen, ihren Kopf zu verschleiern und führten wieder körperliche Züchtigung ein.

Washington vil ha en syndebukk For å frigjøre seg fra sitt engasjement uten å miste ansikt, har USA måttet skylde på en av sine allierte for sine forbrytelser. De har tre muligheter - det er å skylde på Tyrkia, Saudi-Arabia, eller begge. Tyrkia er til stede i Syria og i Ukraina, men ikke i Jemen, mens Saudi-Arabia er til stede i Syria og Jemen, men ikke i Ukraina.
Tyrkia
Vi skal nå komme med den verifiserte informasjonen om hva som virkelig hendte i Tyrkia den 15. juli. Disse opplysningene tvinger oss til å revidere vårt første inntrykk.
Først av alt, det begynte da Tyrkia skulle ta seg av jihadist-hordene etter angrepet som såret den saudiske prins Bandar bin Sultan, det var ikke uten problemer. Mens Bandar var en lydig mellommann, fulgte Erdogan sin egen strategi om å gjenskape det 17. tyrkisk-mongolske imperium. Det fikk han til ved å bruke jihadistene til sitt oppdrag.
I tillegg til dette kunne USA ikke unngå å kreve sanksjoner mot president Erdogan for å blande sitt land økonomisk sammen med Russland mens han fremdeles var et militært medlem av NATO.
Til slutt, med krisen i strukturen om verdensmaktene, ble Erdogan den ideelle syndebukken for USA for å frikjenne seg selv i Syria-krisen.
Fra USAs synspunkt er ikke problemet Tyrkia, som er en uunnværlig regional alliert, heller ikke Hakan Fidans MIT (de hemmelige tjenestene) som organiserer verdens jihadist-bevegelser, men Recep Tayyip Erdogan selv.
Som en konsekvens prøvde National Endowment for Democracy (NED) først av alt å få til en fargerevolusjon i august 2013. De organiserte demonstrasjoner i Cezi-parken i Istanbul. Enten mislyktes planen, eller USA forandret mening.
Det ble tatt en beslutning ved avstemming om å styrte islamistenes Justice and Development Party (AKP) (Erdogans parti overs.). CIA hadde organisert People’s Democratic Party (HDP) til et minoritetsparti, og forberedte også en allianse mellom dem og sosialistene i Republican People’s Party (CHP). HDP vedtok et vidt program til forsvar for etniske minoriteter (kurderne) og sosiale minoriteter (feminister og homoseksuelle) og inkluderte et økologisk kapitel. CHP ble reorganisert av to grunner - å dekke over overrepresentasjonen av Alevis (en mystisk gren av islam overs,) i partiet, og med en tanke om å fremme kandidaturet til eks-presidenten i høyesterett. AKP tapte valget i juli 2015, men det viste seg umulig å få til en allianse mellom CHP og HDP. Som et resultat ble det holdt en ny runde med valg i november 2015, men det ble brutalt manipulert av Recep Tayiip Erdogan.
Washington bestemte seg derfor å fjerne hr. Erdogan. Tre drapsforsøk ble gjort mellom november 2015 og juli 2016. I motsetning til det som er blitt rapportert, var ikke operasjonen den 15. juli 2016 et forsøk på statskupp, men et forsøk på å fjerne Erdogan alene. CIA brukte tyrkisk-USA industrielle og militære forbindelser for å rekruttere et lite team innenfor luftforsvaret for å henrette presidenten mens han var på ferie. Men dette teamet ble forrådt av islamist-offiserer (som representerte nesten en fjerdedel av hærens personell). Og presidenten ble advart en time før kommandogruppen ankom. Han ble derfor overført under beskyttelse av en lojal militæreskorte.
De var klar over de overskuelige konsekvensene av sine feil, allikevel gjennomførte konspiratørene sitt statskupp uten noen forberedelser og mens gatene i Istanbul fremdeles var fulle av folk. Åpenbart nok mislyktes de. Den undertrykkelsen som fulgte var ikke bare bare å arrestere de som hadde stått bak mordforsøket, ikke bare soldatene som hadde samlet seg for å improvisere statskuppet, men alle USA-vennlige aktivister. Først av alle de sekulære Kemalistene, så islamistene i Fethulla-Gulen-bevegelsen. Totalt ble mer enn 70 000 mennesker anklaget, og de vanlige fangene måtte slippes ut for å få plass til å fengsle de USA-vennlige fangene.
President Erdogans stormannsgalskap, hans sinnssyke hvite palass, hans manipulering av valgene og hans totale undertrykkelse gjør han til den ideelle syndebukken for feilene som har blitt gjort i Syria. Men hans motstand mot en fargerevolusjon og de fire mordforsøkene antyder at det ikke vil være mulig å bli kvitt han så fort.
Saudi-Arabia
Saudi-Arabia er like uunnværlig for De Forente Stater som Tyrkia av tre grunner. Først på grunn av oljereservene som har en eksepsjonell kvalitet og eksepsjonell kvantitet (selv om Washington ikke lenger trenger å bruke dem, men bare for å kontrollere salget). Deretter for sine finansielle reserver (selv om disse reservene har falt med 70 %) som gjør dem i stand til å finansiere hemmelige operasjoner som i all stillhet er kontrollert av Kongressen. Og til slutt deres grep om kildene til jihadisme. Faktisk har Riyadh finansiert Muslim World League siden 1962, og de var også med på å grunnlegge denne. Og finansieringen har blitt gjort på vegne av CIA, Det Muslimske Brorskap Naqshbandis, de to organisasjonene som forsyner absolutt alle jihadist-offiserer i hele verden.
Men den anakronistiske karakteren i denne staten er at den er den private eiendommen til den kongelige familien, som er fremmede for det allment aksepterte prinsippet om ytringsfrihet og religionsfrihet. Her kreves det radikale forandringer.
CIA organiserte derfor etterfølgeren etter kong Abdullah i januar 2015. Den natten statsoverhodet døde ble flertallet av de ineffektive offentlig ansatte løst fra sine funksjoner, og landet ble omorganisert etter en på forhånd etablert plan Fra nå av skulle makten deles mellom de tre hovedklanene, Kong Salmane ( og hans elskede sønn prins Mohammed), sønnen til prins Nayef (den andre prins Mohammed), og til slutt sønnen til den avdøde kongen, prins Mutaib, (kommandør for nasjonalgarden).
I praksis lar kong Salmane (81 år gammel) sønnen, den flotte prins Mohammed ( 31 år gammel) styre i hans sted. Mohammed økte det saudiske engasjementet i Syria, deretter gikk han til krig mot Jemen. I tillegg kom han med et enormt program med økonomiske og sosiale reformer som han kalte «Vision for 2030».
Dessverre ble ikke resultatene så strålende som ventet. Kongedømmet var nå engasjert både i Syria og i Jemen. Denne siste krigen er blitt slått tilbake med angrep fra Houtiene på saudiske områder og med tap for hæren hans. Fra et økonomisk synspunkt er de sikre oljereservene gått ned, og tapene i Jemen hindrer han i å utnytte «The Empty Quarter». Det er ørkenregionen som grenser til begge land. Fallet i oljeprisene har ganske sikkert fjernet et antall konkurrenter, men har også tørket inn det saudiske finansdepartementet, som nå ser seg nødt til å låne på det internasjonale markedet.
Saudi-Arabia har aldri vært så mektig som nå, og samtidig så sårbart. Den politiske undertrykkelsen nådde sitt høydepunkt med halshoggingen av lederen for opposisjonen, sjeik Al-Nimr. I shia-minoritetene forberedes nå opprør, men også i sunni-provinsene vest i landet. På internasjonalt nivå ser den arabiske koalisjonen imponerende nok ut. Men den har falt fra hverandre etter at Egypt trakk seg ut. Den offentlige tilnærmingen til Israel mot Iran har reist et ramaskrik i den arabiske og muslimske verden. Heller enn gå inn for en ny allianse, illustrerer dette panikken som har grepet den kongelig familien, som nå er hatet overalt.
Sett fra Washington er øyeblikket kommet for å velge ut de elementene i Saudi-Arabia som er verdt å redde, og å bli kvitt de andre. Rent logisk ville det være å gå tilbake til den tidligere måten, å dele makten mellom Sudariene (men uten prins Mohammed bin Salman, som hadde vist seg ubrukbar) og Chamar (stammen til den avdøde kong Abdullah).
Den beste løsningen for både Washington og det saudiske folket ville være at kong Salmane døde. Sønnen hans, Mohammed ville bli isolert og vekk fra makten. Den ville bli betrodd den andre prins Mohammed (sønnen til Nayef). Prins Mutaib ville beholde sin posisjon. Denne arvefølgen ville bli lettere å styre for Washington hvis den fant sted før innsettelsen av den neste presidenten den 6. januar 2017. Kandidatene ville da kunne anklage den ubrukelige kongen som ansvarlig for alle feil, og så annonsere fred i Syria og Jemen. Dette er CIAs nåværende prosjekt.
I Arabia, som i Tyrkia og i andre nasjoner, søker CIA å opprettholde status quo. Til det formålet prøver de å organisere forsøk på å bytte ut ledere uten å røre strukturene selv. Den kosmetiske måten til disse justeringene gjøres på, gjør det lettere å garantere hvor usynlig arbeidet er.
Moskva prøver å lenke sammen Midt-Østen og Ukraina i forhandlingene Russland har prøvd å lenke sammen den syriske og jemenittiske slagmarken. Mens deres styrker offisielt har vært utplassert i Levanten i et år, har de uoffisielt vært til sted i Jemen i tre måneder, og tar nå aktivt del i kampene. Ved samtidig å forhandle om en våpenhvile i Aleppo og Jemen, har de tvunget USA til gå med på at det er en sammenheng mellom disse to krigsteatrene. I begge disse landene har hæren vist sin overlegenhet med konvensjonelt utstyr når de står ansikt til ansikt med USAs allierte, men har samtidig unngått en direkte konfrontasjon med Pentagon. Disse omgåelsene hindrer Moskva i å investere i Irak, til tross for deres historiske forløpere i dette tredje landet.
Men opprinnelsen til krangelen mellom de to store maktene er i utgangspunktet blokaden av de to Silkeveiene - en i Syria, og en i Ukraina. Logisk nok prøver derfor Moskva å lenke disse to sakene sammen i sine forhandlinger med Washington. Men det er enda mer logisk at CIA selv allerede har skapt en tilknytning mellom de to kamp-plassene via Tyrkia.
Da han dro til Berlin den 19. oktober håpet den russiske president, Vladimir Putin, og hans utenriksminister, Sergej Lavrov, å kunne overbevise Tyskland og Frankrike, om ikke De Forente Stater, om å forene disse sakene. De diskuterte utvidelse av våpenhvilen i Syria og slutt på den ukrainske blokaden av Minsk-avtalen. Disse forretningene må ha irritert Washington, som vil gjøre alt som står i deres makt for å sabotere det.
Naturligvis vil Berlin og Paris til slutt rette seg etter NATOs politikk. Men fra Moskvas synspunkt er en frossen konflikt bedre enn et tap (i Ukraina, som i Transnistria, for eksempel). Og alt som kan skade enheten i NATO er signaler på slutten av USAs overlegenhet.

Los grandes cambios en el transporte marítimo y negocios portuarios por César Reaño Reaño Socios | 26 de octubre de 2016 Los grandes cambios en el transporte marítimo y negocios portuarios ¡Imprescindible modernizar la concepción del negocio marítimo y portuario en Perú para convertir al puerto del Callao en la salida hacia el Asia! La meta indudable, para los próximos decenios es llevar a cabo la gran revolución que viene desde el mar y ponernos a tono con el mundo moderno!
El sistema tradicional del sector comercial marítimo se ve totalmente alterado como consecuencia de la revolución emprendida por el descubrimiento del contenedor el 26 de abril de 1956, cuando Malcolm Mc Lean, transportó en la barcaza “IDEAL X”, los primeros 50 contenedores desde New Jersey a Houston; este impacto continuó y en 1966 se transformó el buque tanque Fairland, siendo el primer buque tanque petrolero convertido en portacontenedores, que estableció la ruta entre New York-Bremen; en 1967 se creó la primera línea naviera norteamericana, con 2 buques cargueros de la segunda Guerra Mundial, los denominados Liberty, transformados en portacontenedores, estableciendo la ruta San Francisco-Los Angeles-Tokio.
En 1968 la naviera japonesa NYK, construyó los primeros 2 buques especialmente diseñados para transporte de contenedores, primera línea competidora de la línea norteamericana.
La evolución y crecimiento de los buques portacontenedores no se detiene, contando el día de hoy con los buques 3E “Económicos, Eficientes y Ecológicos”, con una capacidad de transporte de hasta 21,000 Teus (contenedores de 20 pies), construidos en astilleros de Corea del Sur, por encargo de la CSCL (China Shipping Container Line) de Hong Kong, que cuenta con un motor MAN, de 17 metros de altura, con capacidad de ahorro de combustible, hasta en 20%, en comparación a otros buques que transportan 10,000 Teus.
Esta revolución en el transporte marítimo y negocio portuario se consolida en la década del 70, donde los transportistas marítimos de todo el mundo, se ponen de acuerdo e inician la construcción masiva de buques portacontenedores, como a la vez se inicia la gran transformación de los puertos del mundo para poder dar atención a este nuevo tipo de transporte, para lo cual había que dotar a los puertos de áreas de almacenamiento de contenedores y equiparlos con grúas para la carga y descarga de contenedores.
Lamentablemente los países en vías de desarrollo del Pacífico Sur, no atendieron estos cambios, por el contrario continuaron sus operaciones con el sistema tradicional, con excepción de Chile, que envió a 50 profesionales en el tema comercial marítimo a Europa a prepararse en el nuevo sistema, siendo el puerto de Valparaíso el primero en dar el paso a la modernización desde 1980, continuando el puerto de Santos-Brasil, México, Colombia, Ecuador.
Recién en el 2010 Perú recién asume esta responsabilidad, dotándose al puerto del Callao con las primeras 2 grúas Pórtico Panamax, con un brazo de alcance de 36 metros, siendo ya obsoletas para esa época, porque ya surcaban los mares buques Post Panamax, que necesitaban de grúas modernas y de mayor alcance.
Los temas señalados, sumados a la pésima visión del desarrollo de infraestructura portuaria, falta de vías de comunicación, como carreteras y líneas ferroviarias que alimenten al puerto, están originando que los puertos del Perú, y muy en especial el puerto del Callao, estén quedando rezagados, teniendo el agravante que hasta la fecha, 2016, el gobierno no asigna las zonas de expansión y crecimiento portuario, para crear confianza en los transportistas marítimos, captar nuevos clientes y fidelizarlos; por el contrario el actual gobierno ha quitado competencias a la Autoridad Portuaria Nacional, cediéndolas al sector Defensa, que no tiene competencia ni injerencia en este importante sector comercial, con el subalterno propósito de desaparecerla para engordar las arcas del sector Defensa, dirigidas a la Marina de Guerra del Perú; este manejo no técnico, menos profesional, no permite enganchar a los puertos nacionales en la cadena portuaria internacional.

إنه هو، عين الخطاب، وليس القضايا السياسية، من فجًر الحزب الجمهوري من الداخل، ومن يعيد الآن تشكيل رقعة الشطرنج السياسية، مفسحا المجال لانبثاق شرخ حضاري قديم.
على ضفة، تقف هيلاري كلينتون لتحث على المساواة بين الرجل والمرأة، على الرغم من أنها لم تتردد يوما بمهاجمة وتشويه سمعة النساء اللواتي أقمن علاقات عاطفية مع زوجها، وتقدم نفسها كمرشحة، ليس لميزات شخصية تتحلى بها، بل لمجرد أنها زوج رئيس سابق. تتهم دونالد ترامب بكرهه للنساء، رغم أنه لا يخفي شغفه بالجنس اللطيف.
على الضفة الأخرى، يقف دونالد ترامب ليشجب خصخصة الدولة، وعمليات الابتزاز التي مارستها شخصيات أجنبية من خلال مؤسسة كلينتون، للحصول على موعد معها في وزارة الخارجية، وإنشاء قانون أوباما للرعاية الصحية (أوباما كير) الذي لم يكن قطعا لمصلحة المواطنين، بل لمصلحة شركات التأمين الصحي؛ ويذهب إلى حد التشكيك في مصداقية النظام الانتخابي.
الانقسام الحالي، ناجم عن ثورة القيم الكاثوليكية، والأرثوذكسية، واللوثرية ضد القيم الكالفانية، المتجسدة خصوصا في الولايات المتحدة من خلال البروتستانت، والمعمدانيين والميثوديين (ديانة السيدة كلينتون).
قام أوليفر كرومويل في القرن السابع عشر بانقلاب عسكري أطاح بملك إنجلترا. مدعياً تأسيس نظام جمهوري، وتطهير روح انكلترة، عبر قطع عنق عاهلها.
انشأ نظاما طائفياً من وحي أفكار كالفن، وارتكب مجازر جماعية بحق الايرلنديين الكاتوليك، وفرض نمط حياة متزمتة، وابتدع تصميم الصهيونية: ناشد اليهود في انكلترا، ودعاهم إلى إقامة دولة يهودية في فلسطين. تٌعرف هذه الحقبة الدموية باسم "" الحرب الأهلية البريطانية الأولى"".
هرب أتباع كرومويل المتشددين من انجلترا بعد استعادة النظام الملكي، واستقروا في هولندا، حيث رسى البعض منهم لاحقا على ضفاف"" ماي فلاور"" في القارة الأمريكية، فعرفوا باسم ""الآباء الحٌجًاج"".
كررت حرب الاستقلال الأميركية في القرن الثامن عشر، أحداث المواجهة الكالفانية ضد النظام الملكي البريطاني، لدرجة أن الانكليز أطلقوا عليها اسم ""الحرب الأهلية الثانية"".
في القرن التاسع عشر، أدت الحرب الانفصالية إلى مواجهة مسلحة بين ولايات الجنوب (التي تقطنها أغلبية من المستوطنين الكاثوليك) ضد ولايات الشمال (التي يسكنها عموما مستوطنون بروتستانت).
التاريخ الذي يكتبه عادة المنتصرون، أخبرنا أن تلك الحرب كانت نضالاً من أجل التحرر من العبودية، وهي بالطبع رواية دعائية (بروباغاندا) لأن الولايات الجنوبية ألغت العبودية أثناء الحرب، بعد أن تمكنت من عقد حلف مع المملكة البريطانية).
في الواقع، لاتزال المواجهة مستمرة بين المتشددين، وبين التاج البريطاني الذي يحاول النهوض من جديد.
إنه هو ذاته، الفكر البروتستانتي المتشدد الذي دفع الإدارات المتعاقبة لكل من كارتر، وريغان، وبوش (الأب والابن على حد سواء، أحفاد الآباء الحجاج)، فضلاً عن كلينتون وأوباما لدعم الوهابية، وداعش الآن، رغم تعارضهما مع القيم السامية التي يعلنها بلدهم.
أسس الآباء الحجاج في السابق مجتمعات طائفية في بلايموث وبوسطن، وادعوا إنشاء ""إسرائيل جديدة"". وعلى الرغم من كونهم مسيحيين، فقد أولوا الكتابات اليهودية أهمية أكبر من الإنجيلية، فانتزعوا الصلبان من معابدهم، واستبدلوها بألواح النبي موسى. كما أجبروا النساء على وضع الحجاب وتغطية رؤوسهن بالكامل، وأعادوا تطبيق العقوبات الجسدية.

Hillary Clinton bu seçimlerde programların değil ama « Amerikalıların kim olduğunu » bilme konusunun öne çıktığını açıkladı. Cumhuriyetçilerin önde gelenlerinin Donald Trump’a verdiği desteği geri çekmesi siyasi sorunlardan daha çok kişisel tutumu yüzünden. Yazarımıza göre ABD, bugüne kadar farklı ufuklardan gelen ve özel bir cemaatin ideolojisine boyun eğmeyi kabul eden göçmenlerden oluşuyordu. Bugün, ülkenin bizzat kendisini parçalama tehlikesi riskiyle çatlamakta olan bu modeldir.
Voltaire İletişim Ağı | Şam (Suriye) | 26 Ekim 2016 français Español italiano русский English Deutsch Português ελληνικά عربي Milenarist (yani dünyanın sonunun yaklaştığına inanan) seçmenlerin %73’ü Donald Trump’u beğenmiyor. %68’i demokratların adayı Hillary Clinton’un orta sınıfların haklarını daha iyi koruyacağını; %64’ü dış politika, %61’i ise ekonomi alanında rakibinden daha iyi olduğunu düşünüyor. Geçtiğimiz ABD seçim kampanyası yılı sırasında, retorik derinden değişti ve iki kamp arasında beklenmedik bir bölünme ortaya çıktı. Adaylar başta sadece siyasi konular (servet dağılımı ya da ulusal güvenlik gibi) üzerine konuşsalar da, bugün artık özellikle seks ve paradan bahsediyorlar.
Cumhuriyetçi Partiyi –ki partinin başlıca liderleri adaylarından desteklerini çektiler- sabrını çatlatan ve siyasetin satranç tahtasını yeniden şekillendiren siyasi sorunlar değil, çok eski bir uygarlık bölünmesini hortlatan bu söylemdir. Bayan Clinton bir yandan siyaseten doğru olma çabası içerisindeyken, diğeri, yani « Donald » eski « First Lady »nin ikiyüzlülüğünü ortaya seriyor.
Hillary Clinton, kocasıyla yattıklarını itiraf eden kadınları hedef almaktan ve lekelemekten çekinmemesine rağmen, bir yandan kadın-erkek eşitliğini savunurken, kendini kişisel nitelikleriyle değil ama eski bir Başkanın eşi olarak sunarken, kadın cinsiyetine karşı duygularını gizlemediği için Donald Trump’u kadın düşmanlığıyla suçluyor. Diğer yandan Donald Trump Devletin özelleştirilmesi sürecini ve Dışişleri Bakanlığından randevu elde edebilmeleri için Clinton Vakfı aracılığıyla yabancı şahsiyetlerden para sızdırılmasını; ObamaCare’in kuruluşunun yurttaşların değil ama sağlık sigortalarının yararına hizmet ettiğini teşhir ediyor ve işi seçim sisteminin doğruluğunu tartışmaya kadar götürüyor.
Donald Trump’un kendini ifade etme tarzının ırkçılığı yüreklendirdiğinin tamamen farkındayım ama Clinton yanlısı medyaların çıkarttığı patırtıya rağmen bunun seçim tartışmasının merkezinde olduğunu hiçbir şekilde düşünmüyorum.
Lewinsky olayı sırasında, Başkan Bill Clinton’un ulustan özür dilemesi ve selameti için rahipleri bir araya getirmesi önemlidir. Oysa bir ses kaydı aracılığıyla benzer olgularla suçlanan Donald Trump, din adamları sınıfından yardım dilenmeden sadece hedef aldığı kişilerden özür dilemekle yetinmiştir.
Bugünkü bölünme, ABD’de Presbiteryenler, Vaftizciler ve Metodistler tarafından temsil edilen Kalvinistlere karşı Katolik, Ortodoks ve Luther’cilerin değerlerinin isyanını yeniden gündeme getirmektedir.
Her ne kadar iki aday da püriten gelenek içerisinde eğitilmiş olsalar da (Clinton Metodist ve Trump Presbiteryen), Bayan Clinton Babasının ölümüyle birlikte dinine geri döndü ve bugün silahlı kuvvetler genelkurmayının The Family adı verilen ayin gruplarına katılıyor. Trump’a gelince daha içsel bir tinsellik uyguluyor ve o kadar sık tapınaklara gitmiyor.
Tabi ki, kimse yetiştirildiği şemalar içerisinde kapalı kalmıyor. Ama düşünmeden hareket ettiğimizde, haberimiz olmadan bunları üretiveriyoruz. Herkesin dini çevresi sorunu dolayısıyla önemli olabilir.
Neler olduğunu daha iyi anlayabilmemiz için XVIInci yüzyıl İngiltere’sine geri dönmemiz gerekiyor. Oliver Cromwell, yaptığı askeri darbe ile Kral I.Charles’ı devirir. Bir Cumhuriyet kuracağı, ülkenin ruhunu arındıracağı iddiasında bulundu ve eski hükümdarın kellesini uçurdu. Kalvin’in düşüncelerinden esinlenen sekter bir rejim kurdu, Papa’ya bağlı İrlandalıları kitlesel olarak katletti ve püriten yaşam tarzını dayattı. Aynı zamanda Siyonizm’i de tasarladı: Yahudileri İngiltere’ye geri çağırdı ve Filistin’de bir Yahudi Devletinin kurulmasını talep eden dünyanın ilk Devlet başkanı oldu. Bu kanlı serüven, « Britanya’nın ilk iç savaşı » adıyla anılıyor.
Monarşinin yeniden kurulmasından sonra, Cromwell’in Püritenleri İngiltere’den kaçarlar. Hollanda’ya yerleşirler ve aralarından bazıları Mayflower gemisiyle Amerika’ya giderken (« Pilgrimler »), bazıları güney Afrika’da Afrikaneer topluluğunu kurarlar. XVIIInci yüzyıldaki ABD Bağımsızlık Savaşı sırasında, Kalvinistlerin Britanya monarşisine karşı mücadelesine yeniden tanık oluruz. Bu mücadele, Britanya tarihi güncel el yazmalarında « İkinci İç Savaş » olarak tanımlanır.
XIXncu yüzyıldaki İç Savaş, Güney Devletleriyle (genelde Katolik kolonların yaşadığı) Kuzeydekileri (daha çok Protestan kolonların yaşadığı) karşı karşıya geldi. Galip gelenlerin yazdığı tarih bu çatışmayı köleliğe karşı özgürlük kavgası olarak sunuyor ki bu propagandadan başka bir şey değildir (Güney Devletleri, Britanya monarşisiyle bir ittifak anlaşmasına vardıklarında köleliği kaldırmışlardır). Dolayısıyla da, Püritenlerle İngiliz tahtının çatışması yeniden karşımıza çıkar ki bazı tarihçiler bu yüzden burada bir « Üçüncü Britanya İç Savaşından » söz ederler.
XXinci yüzyıl sırasında, Başbakan David Llyod George’un « konformist olmayan Hıristiyanlarıyla » Birleşik Krallıkta yeniden ortaya çıkmasını saymazsak, Britanya uygarlığının bu iç çatışması bitmiş gibidir. Bunlar İrlanda’yı bölerler ve Filistin’de « Yahudi ulusal yurdunu » yaratmaya girişirler.
Ne olursa olsun, Richard Nixon’un danışmanlarından biri olan Kevin Philips, bu iç savaşlarla ilgili geniş kapsamlı bir tez hazırlar, sorunların hiçbirinin çözülmediği tespitinde bulunur ve bir dördüncü çatışmanın duyurusunu yapar [ 1 ].
40 yıldan beri kitlesel olarak Cumhuriyetçilere oy veren Kalvinist Kilisesinin müritleri, artık Demokratları destekliyor.
Bayan Clinton’un ABD’nin yeni Başkanı olacağından ya da Bay Trump seçildiğinde, hızlı bir şekilde ortadan kaldırılacağından şüphe etmiyorum. Ama birkaç ay içerisinde, geridöndürülemez bir demografik gelişim temelinde seçmenler topluluğunun yeniden şekillenişine tanık oluyoruz. Halkın dörtte birinden fazlasını bir araya getiren Püriten kökenli Kiliseler, Demokratların kampına doğru kayıyor. Modelleri tarihsel bir kaza gibi görünüyor. Güney Afrika’da ortadan kalktı ve ne ABD’de, ne de İsrail’de daha çok hayatta kalması mümkün değil.
Başkanlık seçiminin ötesinde, ABD toplumu hızla gelişmek ya da yeniden parçalanmak durumundadır. Gençliğin Püriten vaizlerin nüfuzunu kitlesel olarak reddettiği bir ülkede, eşitlik sorununu başka yöne kaydırmak artık mümkün değildir. Püritenler tüm insanların eşit olduğu ama eşdeğer olmadığı bir toplum öngörüyorlar. Lord Cromwell İngilizler için bir cumhuriyet istiyordu, ama ancak Papa yanlısı İrlandalıları katlettikten sonra. Böylece bugün ABD’de bütün yurttaşlar kanun önünde eşittir, ama aynı yasal metinlerden hareketle, mahkemeler aynı cinayet ya da suçlarla ilgili beyazlar için hafifletici nedenler bulurken sistematik olarak siyahları mahkum etmektedir. Ve eyaletlerin çoğunda, hız ihlali için dahi olsa ceza alınması durumunda, oy kullanma hakkı kaldırılıyor. Bunun sonucunda, beyaz ve siyahlar eşittirler, ama bazı eyaletlerde, siyahi insanların birçoğunun aynı şekilde oy kullanma hakkı elinden alınmıştır. Bu düşüncenin paradigması, dış politikada, Filistin’de « iki Devletli çözümdür »; eşit, ama özellikle eşdeğer olmayan.
Rahip Carter, Reagan, Bush (Sr. ve Jr.’in her ikisi de Pilgrimlerin torunlarıdırlar), Clinton ve Obama yönetimlerini, kendi ülkelerinin ideallerine aykırı bir biçimde Vahhabiliği ve bugün de IŞİD’i desteklemeye Püriten düşüncesi itmiştir.
Geçmişte Pilgrimler, Plymouth ve Boston’de ABD’nin ortak hafızasında idealleştirilen topluluklar oluşturdular. Oysa tarihçiler biçimseldirler, « Yeni İsrail »’i oluşturduklarını söylüyorlardı ve « Musa’nın Yasasını » seçerler. Tapınaklarına Haç değil ama Yasanın Masalarını yerleştirirler. Zaten Hıristiyan olmalarına rağmen, Yahudi yazmalarına İncil’den daha çok önem veriyorlardı. Kadınlarını başlarını örtmeye zorladılar ve bedensel cezaları yeniden gündeme getirdiler.

September 2016 sahen Arbeiter bei der Reinigung der Umgebung einer verlassenen Höhlenunterkunft nahe der Kirche Saint-Florent an der Ausfahrt von Saumur (Frankreich) drei Männer, die überstürzt in einem weißen Lieferwagen flohen. Als sie in die Grotte eindrangen, entdeckten sie Videomaterial, einen Generator, Zeitschriften in arabischer Sprache und die Fahnen von Daesch.
Bei der Beschwichtigung der Aufregung in der Bevölkerung, bei der Polizei und Gendarmerie und dem Unterpräfekten erklärte Arnaud Nicolazo de Barmon, der Kommandant der Militärschulen von Saumur, dass es sich nicht um Terroristen handele, sondern um eine Übung des teilstreitkräfteübergreifenden Zentrums für die nukleare, radiologische, biologische und chemische Verteidigung (CIA NBCR).
Wenn dies mitten im Ausnahmezustand der Fall war, hat die CIA NBCR gegen die Vorschriften zur Bekanntmachung dieser Übung vor ihrer Durchführung bei verschiedenen Kommunalbehörden verstoßen. Darüber hinaus ist nicht einsichtig, inwiefern dieses Material irgendeinen Nutzen für Übungen zur nuklearen, radiologischen, biologischen und chemischen Gefahrenabwehr haben sollte.
In denselben Räumlichkeiten der CIA NBCR in Saumur befinden sich Schulen, die auf Nachrichtendienste und das Gefecht der Verbundenen Waffen spezialisiert sind.
Seit Beginn der Ereignisse in Syrien 2011 ist dort die Anwesenheit französischer Streitkräfte nachgewiesen. 2012 waren 19 französische Soldaten, die gefangen genommen worden waren, an der libanesischen Grenze dem Generalstabschef der Streitkräfte, Édouard Guillaud, zusammen mit anderen Soldaten, die dem Islamische Emirat von Baba Amr zugeordnet waren, übergeben worden. Der Tod von französischen Soldaten in Begleitung islamistischer Truppen ist an vielen Orten bescheinigt worden, besonders 2013 in Sanayeh. Obwohl Frankreich 2014 al-Qaida gegen Daesch unterstützt hat, wurde 2016 die Anwesenheit französischer Offiziere im Kalifat von mehreren Zeugen bestätigt.
Im November 2014 gab das Pentagon bekannt, in Samarda einen Agenten des französischen Auslandsnachrichtendienst (DGSE), David Drugeon, der innnerhalb der al-Qaida arbeitete, getötet zu haben, während das französische Verteidigungsministerium jede Verbindung zu dem Opfer dementierte. Im Anschluss bestätigte die US-amerikanische Presse, David Drugeon habe Mohamed Mera (Attentat von Toulouse und von Montauban) und die Brüder Kouachi (Attentat gegen Charlie Hebdo ) ausgebildet.
Frankreich hat sich nie offiziell dazu bekannt, Soldaten auf syrischem Boden zu haben, obwohl es zugegeben hat, dort ein gemeinsames Hauptquartier mit verbündeten Spezialkräften zu unterhalten.

Thierry Meyssan Ao observar a campanha eleitoral presidencial norte-americana, Thierry Meyssan analisa a ressurgência de um velho e grande conflito civilizacional. Hillary Clinton acaba de declarar que esta eleição não versava sobre programas, mas sobre a questão de saber «Quem são os Americanos?». Não é baseados em questões políticas que os tenores republicanos acabam de retirar o seu apoio ao seu candidato, Donald Trump, mas antes a propósito do seu comportamento pessoal. Segundo o nosso autor, até à data presente, os Norte-americanos eram emigrantes vindos de horizontes diferentes e aceitando submeter-se à ideologia de uma comunidade especial. É este modelo que está em vias de se desfazer, com o risco de estilhaçar o próprio país.
Rede Voltaire | Damasco (Síria) | 26 de Outubro de 2016 français Español italiano русский English Deutsch ελληνικά Türkçe عربي No decurso do ano de campanha eleitoral norte-americana que estamos a acabar de atravessar, a retórica mudou profundamente e uma clivagem inesperada surgiu entre os dois campos. Se, à partida, os candidatos falavam de assuntos basicamente políticos (tais como a repartição de riqueza ou a segurança nacional), agora eles tratam principalmente de sexo e dinheiro.
Foi este discurso, e não as questões políticas, o que fez explodir o Partido Republicano –-cujos principais líderes retiraram o apoio ao seu candidato–- e que reformula o tabuleiro político, fazendo ressurgir uma clivagem civilizacional muito velha. De um lado, a senhora Clinton pretende ser politicamente correcta, enquanto do outro «O Donald» fez voar em estilhaços a hipocrisia da antiga «primeira Dama».
De um lado, Hillary Clinton promove a igualdade homens/mulheres, muito embora ela jamais tenha hesitado em atacar e emporcalhar as mulheres que revelavam ter-se deitado com o seu marido; que se apresenta não pelas suas qualidades pessoais, mas enquanto esposa de um anterior presidente, e que ela acusa Donald Trump de misoginia porque ele não esconde o seu gosto pela espécie feminina. Do outro lado, Donald Trump denuncia a privatização do Estado, e a extorsão de personalidades estrangeiras pela Fundação Clinton, sempre que queriam obter acesso ao Departamento de Estado; a criação do ObamaCare, não no interesse dos cidadãos mas para benefício dos Seguros médicos; e vai até ao ponto de pôr em causa a idoneidade do sistema eleitoral.
Estou perfeitamente ciente que a maneira como Donald Trump se exprime encoraja de facto o racismo, mas não acho de todo que isto esteja no centro do debate eleitoral apesar do martelar que os média(mídia) pró-Clinton fazem a propósito.
Não é indiferente que, aquando do escândalo Lewinsky, o presidente Bill Clinton tenha apresentado as suas desculpas à Nação e tenha reunido Pastores para rezar pela sua salvação. Enquanto ao ser posto em causa por factos parecidos, numa gravação áudio, Donald Trump se tenha contentado a apresentar as suas desculpas às pessoas atingidas, sem fazer apelo a membros do clero.
A clivagem actual retoma a revolta de valores dos Católicos, de Ortodoxos, e de Luteranos, contra os dos Calvinistas, representados nos Estados Unidos principalmente pelos Presbiterianos, Baptistas e os Metodistas.
Mesmo se os dois candidatos foram educados na tradição puritana (Clinton como Metodista e Trump como Presbiteriano), H.Clinton retornou à religião pela morte do seu pai e participa hoje em dia no grupo de oração dos chefes do estado-maior das forças armadas, The Family («A Família»- ndT), enquanto Trump segue uma espiritualidade mais interiorizada e não frequenta habitualmente os templos.
É claro, ninguém fica fechado nos padrões em que foi criado. Mas, quando se age sem reflexão, podemos reproduzi-los de forma inconsciente. A questão do ambiente religioso de cada um pode portanto ser importante.
Para entender o que está em jogo, é preciso voltar à Inglaterra do século XVII. Oliver Cromwell derruba, com um golpe de Estado militar, o rei Carlos Iº. Ele pretendeu instaurar uma República, purificar a alma do país, e assim fez decapitar o antigo soberano. Criou um regime sectário inspirado nas ideias de Calvino, massacrou os Irlandeses papistas em massa, e impôs um modo de vida puritano. Concebeu também o sionismo: ele chamou à atenção para os judeus em Inglaterra e foi o primeiro chefe de Estado, no mundo, a reivindicar a criação de um Estado judeu na Palestina. Este episódio sangrento é conhecido com o nome de «Primeira Guerra civil britânica».
Após a restauração da monarquia, os Puritanos de Cromwell fugiram da Inglaterra. Eles instalaram-se nos Países Baixos, de onde alguns de entre eles partiram a bordo do Mayflower para as Américas (os chamados “Pais Peregrinos""), enquanto outros fundaram a comunidade Afrikaner na África Austral. Aquando da guerra de independência dos Estados Unidos, no século XVIII, reviu-se o confronto dos Calvinistas contra a Monarquia britânica, de tal modo que nos manuais actuais de História Britânica, designam-na como a «Segunda Guerra civil».
No século XIX, a Guerra de Secessão opôs os Estados do Sul (sobretudo habitados por colonos católicos) aos do Norte (principalmente habitados por colonos protestantes). A História dos vencedores apresenta este confronto como uma luta pela Liberdade face à Escravatura, o que é pura propaganda (os Estados do Sul aboliram a escravatura durante a guerra, quando fecharam uma aliança com a monarquia britânica). Com efeito, regressa-se ao enfrentamento dos Puritanos contra o Trono inglês, razão pela qual certos historiadores falam aqui de uma «Terceira Guerra civil britânica».
Durante o século XX, este enfrentamento interno da civilização britânica parecia ultrapassado, fora o ressurgimento dos Puritanos ao Reino Unido com «os cristãos não-conformistas» do primeiro-ministro David Lloyd George. Estes últimos dividiram a Irlanda e dedicaram-se a criar o «Lar nacional judaico» na Palestina.
Seja como fôr, um dos conselheiros de Richard Nixon, Kevin Phillips, consagrou uma volumosa tese a estas guerras civis, constatando que nenhum dos problemas estava resolvido e anunciou uma quarta volta [ 1 ].
Os adeptos das Igrejas calvinistas, que desde há 40 anos votavam maciçamente pelos Republicanos, apoiam agora os Democratas.
Eu não duvido que H. Clinton será a próxima Presidente dos Estados Unidos, ou que se Trump fosse eleito, ele seria rapidamente eliminado. Mas, em alguns meses, assiste-se a uma ampla redistribuição eleitoral sobre o fundo de uma evolução demográfica irreversível. As Igrejas vindas dos Puritanos não somam mais que um quarto da população e basculam para o campo Democrata. O seu modelo aparece como um acidente histórico. Ele já desapareceu na África do Sul e não poderá sobreviver ainda por muito mais tempo, nem nos Estados Unidos, nem em Israel.
Para além da eleição presidencial, a sociedade dos EUA deve evoluir rapidamente ou irá dilacerar-se novamente. Num país onde o juventude rejeita maciçamente a influência dos pregadores puritanos, não é mais possível mover a questão da igualdade. Os puritanos idealizam uma sociedade onde os homens são todos iguais, mas não equivalentes. Lorde Cromwell queria uma República para o Ingleses, mas só depois de ter massacrado os papistas Irlandeses. É assim que actualmente nos Estados Unidos, todos os cidadãos são iguais perante a lei mas, em nome dos mesmos textos, os tribunais condenam sistematicamente negros enquanto encontram circunstâncias atenuantes no caso de brancos tendo cometido crimes ou delitos equivalentes. E, na maioria dos Estados, uma condenação penal, mesmo por um excesso de velocidade, basta para retirar o direito de voto. Por conseguinte, brancos e negros são iguais, mas em alguns Estados, a maioria dos negros tem legalmente sido privada do seu direito de voto. O paradigma deste pensamento, em política externa, é a «solução de dois Estados» na Palestina: iguais, mas acima de tudo não equivalentes.
Foi o pensamento puritano que orientou as administrações do Pastor Carter, de Reagan, de Bush (o Sr. e o Jr. são dois descendentes directos dos “Pais Peregrinos”), de Clinton e de Obama a apoiar o wahabismo, em contradição com os ideais propagados pelo seu país, e hoje em dia a apoiar o Daesh(E.I.).
No passado, os “Pais Peregrinos” fundaram comunidades em Plymouth e Boston, que foram mitificadas na memória colectiva americana. Contudo os historiadores são rigorosos. Eles afirmavam construir o «Novo Israel» e escolheram a «Lei de Moisés». Eles não colocaram a Cruz nos seus templos, mas, sim as Tábuas da Lei. Muito embora cristãos, atribuíam mais importância às Escrituras Judaicas que aos Evangelhos. Eles obrigaram as suas mulheres a tapar a cabeça com véu e restabeleceram os castigos corporais.

Тьерри Мейсан Наблюдая за президентской гонкой в США Тьерри Мейсан отмечает возрождение давно забытых распрей. Хилари Клинтон недавно заявила, что на этих выборах главное не выбрать какую-то программу, а ответить на вопрос, кем являются американцы. На самом деле, не по политическим соображениям руководители республиканской партии отказались поддерживать своего кандидата Дональда Трампа, а из-за его поведения. До сих пор США остаются страной эмигрантов, прибывших со всех концов света и считающих свою страну особым государством. Однако реальная ситуация даёт о себе знать, и эти представления рушатся, что может повлечь за собой разрушение самих США.
Сеть Вольтер | Дамаск (Сирия) | 26 октября 2016 français Español italiano English Deutsch Português ελληνικά Türkçe عربي За время избирательной кампании, которая близится к завершению, риторика кандидатов значительно изменилась, и между двумя лагерями наметился раскол. Если вначале кандидаты обсуждали чисто политические вопросы (например, распределение материальных средств или национальная безопасность), то сегодня они рассуждают, в основном, о сексуальных отношениях и деньгах.
Именно эти, а не политические вопросы взорвали Республиканскую партию, лидеры которой отказались поддерживать своего кандидата, а это перемешало всю политическую шахматную доску и воскресило давно забытые распри. Г-жа Клинтон, с одной стороны, старается сохранять политическую корректность, а «Дональд», со своей стороны, разбивает в пух и прах лицемерие бывшей «Первой леди».
Хилари Клинтон выступает за равенство между мужчинами и женщинами, хотя она без колебаний нападала и очерняла тех, кто рассказывал о своих связях с её мужем, представляет себя не по своим личным качествам, а лишь как жена бывшего президента, и обвиняет в женоненавистничестве Дональда Трампа, который не скрывает своего неравнодушного отношения к женскому полу. А Дональд Трамп клеймит приватизацию государства и коррупцию Фонда Клинтон при предоставлении иностранным гражданам доступа в Госдеп, проведённую Обамой реформу здравоохранения, выгодную не гражданам, а медицинским страховым агентствам. Он доходит даже до обвинений в адрес самой избирательной системы.
Я совершенно согласен с тем, что речи Дональда Трампа порой смахивают на расизм, но я не считаю это основным содержанием предвыборной кампании, несмотря на тот шум, который делают из этого проклинтоновские СМИ.
Президент Клинтон по делу Моники Левински принёс публичные извинения и обратился к пасторам молиться о его прощении. И это важно. А Дональд Трамп, которого обвинили в подобных деяниях и подтвердили их звукозаписью, извинился только перед теми, кого он унизил, и к помощи духовенства не обратился.
Такие расхождения вызывают у католиков, православных и лютеран возмущение против кальвинистов, представленных в США, главным образом, пресвитерианами, баптистами и методистами. И хотя оба кандидата воспитывались в пуританских традициях (Клинтон как методистка, а Трамп как пресвитерианин), г-жа Клинтон обратилась к религии после смерти отца и сегодня она ходит на мессу в составе группы The Family, включающей начальников армейских штабов, а г-н Трамп свои религиозные чувства не выказывает и соборы почти не посещает.
Конечно, никто жёстко не ограничивает себя рамками канонов, по которым его воспитывали. Но когда у человека нет времени на раздумья, он бессознательно действует по этим канонам. Поэтому религиозная среда, в которой человек вырос, имеет значение.
Чтобы осмыслить, что поставлено на кон, нужно вернуться в Англию XVII века. Оливер Кромвель с помощью военного переворота смещает короля Карла Первого и устанавливает республику. Он намерен очистить стране её душу и приказывает казнить бывшего монарха. Руководствуясь идеями Кальвина, он устанавливает сектарный режим, массово расправляется с ирландскими папистами и вводит в стране пуританский образ жизни. Он также породил сионизм, призвав евреев в Англию, и стал первым в мире главой государства, который потребовал создания в Палестине еврейского государства. Этот кровавый эпизод вошёл в историю под названием Первой гражданской войны в Англии.
После возрождения монархии кромвелевские пуритане бегут из Англии. Они поселяются в Нидерландах, откуда некоторые из них на борту May flower направляются к берегам Америки и становятся «отцами-пилигримами», а другие в Южную Африку и становятся африканерами. Во время войны за независимость в США в XVIII веке кальвинисты вновь сталкиваются с Британской монархией, но в современных английских учебниках истории это называется Второй гражданской войной.
В XVIII веке во время войны Севера и Юга южные штаты, населённые в основном католиками, столкнулись с северными, где преобладали протестанты. История, написанная победителями, описывает эти события как борьбу за свободу и против рабства, что является чистейшей пропагандой, так как южные штаты отменили рабство во время войны, когда они заключили союз с британской монархией. По факту, это было выступление против британского трона, и некоторые историки по этой причине говорят о Третьей британской гражданской войне.
В ХХ веке распри внутри англо-саксов возобновляются, хотя в Соединённом Королевстве пуритане едины с христианами-неконформистами Премьер-министра Дэвида Ллойд Джорджа. Последние отделили Ирландию и вознамерились создать в Палестине «Еврейский очаг». Один из советников Ричарда Никсона Филипс Кельвин посвятил этим войнам обширную монографию, в которой он пришёл к выводу, что ни одна из проблем не была решена, и предсказал новую схватку [ 1 ].
Адепты кальвинистских церквей в течение 40 лет массово голосовали за республиканцев, а теперь они поддерживают демократов.
Я не сомневаюсь, что следующим президентом США станет г-жа Клинтон, а если г-н Трамп и будет избран, то его быстро устранят. Но за все эти несколько месяцев мы стали свидетелями масштабного перераспределения голосов в результате необратимого демографического процесса. Пуритане составляют всего лишь четверть населения страны, и многие из них склоняются к лагерю демократов. Но и их модель представляется исторической катастрофой. Она приказала долго жить в Южной Африке и не сможет долго просуществовать ни в США, ни в Израиле. После избрания президента, ситуация в США будет быстро изменяться, и вновь наступит разлад. В стране, где молодёжь поголовно не приемлет власть пуританских проповедников, вопрос о равенстве нельзя будет больше замалчивать. Пуритане выступают за общество, где все люди равны, но не равнозначны. Лорд Кромвель выступал за республику для англичан, но только после того, как перерезал ирландских папистов. Точно так же в США сегодня все равны перед законом, однако суды по одним и тем же статьям негров осуждают, а белым за те же преступления находят смягчающие обстоятельства. Во многих штатах одного лишь наказания за превышение скорости достаточно для того, чтобы человека лишили избирательного права. Так что белые и чёрные равны, но в ряде штатов многие чернокожие по суду лишены избирательного права. Парадигмой такого мышления во внешней политике является решение по «двум государствам в Палестине» - они равные, но, что более существенно, не равнозначные.
Пуританская идеология способствовала тому, что администрации пастора Картера, Рейгана, Буша (и мл., и ст. являются прямыми потомками «Отцов-пилигримов»), Клинтона и Обамы поддерживали ваххабизм вопреки афишируемым в стране идеалам. А в наши дни эта идеология используется для поддержки ИГИЛ.
Когда-то «Отцы-пилигримы» в Бостоне и Плимуте основали поселения, которые впоследствии были идеализированы в американском общественном сознании. Но историки более лаконичны, они назвали их «Новым Израилем», избравшим «закон Моисея». Их жители в своих соборах крестов не ставили, а расписывали их заповедями Моисея. Будучи христианами, они больше ценили еврейские тексты, чем евангельские. А своих женщин они обязали покрывать голову и ввели телесные наказания.

Σύμφωνα με τον συγγραφέα μας, μέχρι στιγμής, οι Αμερικανοί ήταν μετανάστες από διαφορετικούς ορίζοντες που δέχονταν να υποβάλλονται στην ιδεολογία μιας συγκεκριμένης κοινότητας.

Δίκτυο Βολταίρος | Δαμασκός (Συρία) | 26 octobre 2016 français Español italiano русский English Deutsch Português Türkçe عربي Κατά τη διάρκεια του έτους της αμερικανικής προεκλογικής εκστρατείας που μόλις διανύσαμε, η ρητορική άλλαξε ριζικά και εμφανίστηκε μια απρόσμενη διάσπαση μεταξύ των δύο στρατοπέδων. Ενώ, στη αρχή, οι υποψήφιοι μιλούσαν για καθαρά πολιτικά θέματα (όπως τη διανομή του πλούτου ή την εθνική ασφάλεια), σήμερα ασχολούνται κυρίως με το σεξ και το χρήμα.
Δεν είναι τα πολιτικά ζητήματα που ανατίναξαν το Ρεπουμπλικανικό Κόμμα - του οποίου οι κυριότεροι ηγέτες απέσυραν την υποστήριξή στον υποψήφιο τους - αλλά ένα πολύ παλιό πολιτισμικό χάσμα. Η κα Κλίντον υπερασπίζεται το πολιτικά ορθό, ενώ ""ο Ντόναλντ"" γκρεμίζει την υποκρισία της πρώην ""πρώτης Κυρίας"".
Από τη μια πλευρά, η Χίλαρι Κλίντον προωθεί την ισότητα των δύο φύλων, αν και δεν δίστασε να επιτεθεί και να βρωμίσει τις γυναίκες που αποκάλυπταν ότι είχαν σεξουαλικές σχέσεις με τον σύζυγό της και κατηγορεί τον Ντόναλντ Τραμπ για μισογυνισμό, επειδή δεν κρύβει την αδυναμία του για το θηλυκό γένος. Από την άλλη, ο Ντόναλντ Τραμπ καταγγέλλει την ιδιωτικοποίηση του κράτους καθώς επίσης τον εκβιασμό από μέλη του Ιδρύματος Κλίντον προκειμένου να εξασφαλίσουν ένα ραντεβού στο Στέιτ Ντιπάρτμεντ. Ακόμα δεν δίστασε να κατηγορήσει το Obamacare που δεν εξυπηρετεί τα συμφέροντα των πολιτών, αλλά εκείνα των ιδιωτικών εταιρειών ιατρικής ασφάλισης. Έφτασε δε, στο σημείο να θέσει υπό αμφισβήτηση την ακεραιότητα του εκλογικού συστήματος.
Έχω πλήρη συνείδηση ότι με το τρόπο που μιλάει ο Ντόναλντ Τραμπ, ενθαρρύνει πράγματι τον ρατσισμό, αλλά δεν πιστεύω καθόλου ότι ο τελευταίος βρίσκεται στη καρδιά του προεκλογικού ντιμπέιτ, αλλά στη διαφημιστική εκστρατεία που αναπτύσσεται από τα μίντια υπέρ της Κλίντον.
Δεν είναι αδιάφορο το γεγονός, ότι κατά τη διάρκεια της υπόθεσης Λεβίνσκι, ο πρόεδρος Μπιλ Κλίντον ζήτησε συγνώμη από το έθνος και συγκέντρωσε πάστορες για να προσευχηθούν για τη σωτηρία του. Ενώ εξεταζόμενος για κατηγορίες για παρόμοιες πράξεις σε κάποια ηχητική καταγραφή, ο Ντόναλντ Τραμπ αρκέστηκε να ζητήσει συγγνώμη από εκείνες που είχε προσβάλει χωρίς τη συμμετοχή κληρικών.
Η σημερινή κατάσταση θυμίζει την εξέγερση των Καθολικών, των Ορθοδόξων και των Λουθηρανών κατά των Καλβινιστών, οι οποίοι εκπροσωπούνται κυρίως στις ΗΠΑ από τους Πρεσβυτεριανούς, τους Βαπτιστές και τους Μεθοδιστές.
Αν και οι δύο υποψήφιοι μεγάλωσαν με πουριτανική παράδοση (η Κλίντον ανατράφηκε ως ευσεβής Μεθοδίστρια και ο Τραμπ ως Πρεσβυτεριανός), η κα Κλίντον επέστρεψε στη θρησκεία με το θάνατο του πατέρα της και συμμετέχει σήμερα στην ομάδα προσευχής των Επιτελαρχών του στρατού, The Family (η Οικογένεια), ενώ ο κ Τραμπ ασκεί μια πιο εσωτερικευμένη πνευματικότητα και δεν συχνάζει στους ναούς.
Φυσικά, κανείς δεν είναι δεμένος στα σχήματα του συστήματος με το οποίο ανατράφηκε, αλλά όταν κάποιος ενεργεί χωρίς σκέψη, αναπαράγονται ερήμην του. Το ζήτημα του θρησκευτικού περιβάλλοντος του καθενός μπορεί επομένως να είναι σημαντικό.
Για να καταλάβουμε το τι διακυβεύεται, θα πρέπει να επιστρέψουμε στην Αγγλία του δέκατου έβδομου αιώνα. Ο Όλιβερ Κρόμγουελ ανέτρεψε με στρατιωτικό πραξικόπημα τον βασιλιά Κάρολο Α’. Ισχυρίστηκε ότι θα εγκαθιδρύσει μια Δημοκρατία (res publicum), ότι θα καθαρίζει την ψυχή της χώρας, και αποκεφάλισε τον πρώην κυρίαρχο. Δημιούργησε ένα σεκταριστικό καθεστώς εμπνευσμένο από τις ιδέες του Καλβίνου, σφαγίασε μαζικά τους παπικούς Ιρλανδούς, και επέβαλε έναν πουριτανικό τρόπο ζωής. Οραματίστηκε επίσης, για πρώτη φορά ιστορικά, τον Σιωνισμό: έφερε πίσω τους Εβραίους στην Αγγλία και ήταν ο πρώτος αρχηγός κράτους στον κόσμο που απαίτησε τη δημιουργία ενός εβραϊκού κράτους στην Παλαιστίνη. Αυτό το αιματηρό επεισόδιο είναι γνωστό ως «Πρώτος βρετανικός Εμφύλιος Πόλεμος».
Μετά την αποκατάσταση της μοναρχίας, οι Πουριτανοί του Κρόμγουελ έφυγαν από την Αγγλία. Εγκαταστάθηκαν στην Ολλανδία, όπου ορισμένοι έφυγαν με το Mayflower στην Αμερική (οι «Πατέρες Προσκυνητές»), ενώ άλλοι ίδρυσαν την κοινότητα των Afrikaner στη Νότια Αφρική. Κατά τη διάρκεια του Αμερικανικού Πολέμου Ανεξαρτησίας τον δέκατο όγδοο αιώνα, ξαναείδαμε τη σύγκρουση των Καλβινιστών εναντίον της βρετανικής Μοναρχίας, μάλιστα στα σημερινά βρετανικά εγχειρίδια ιστορίας, αναφέρεται ως ο «Δεύτερος Εμφύλιος Πόλεμος».
Τον δέκατο ένατο αιώνα, στον Αμερικανικό Εμφύλιο οι νότιες πολιτείες (οι έποικοι των οποίων ήταν κυρίως καθολικοί ) πολέμησαν με εκείνες του Βορρά (που είχε κυρίως προτεστάντες έποικους). Η Ιστορία των νικητών παρουσιάσει αυτόν τον πόλεμο ως μια πάλη για την ελευθερία ενάντια στη δουλεία, κάτι που είναι καθαρή προπαγάνδα (οι Νότιες Πολιτείες κατήργησαν τη δουλεία κατά τη διάρκεια του πολέμου, όταν συνήψαν μια συμμαχία με τη βρετανική Μοναρχία) Στην ουσία, επαναλήφθηκε η σύγκρουση των Πουριτανών κατά του αγγλικού θρόνου, λόγος για τον οποίον μερικοί ιστορικοί μιλούν για τον «Τρίτο Βρετανικό Εμφύλιο Πόλεμο».
Κατά τη διάρκεια του εικοστού αιώνα, αυτή η εσωτερική αντιπαράθεση του βρετανικού πολιτισμού φαινόταν ξεπερασμένη, εκτός από την αναβίωση των Πουριτανών στο Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο με τους «μη κομφορμιστές Χριστιανούς» του πρωθυπουργού Ντέιβιντ Λόιντ Τζορτζ. Οι τελευταίοι χώρισαν την Ιρλανδία και ανέλαβαν να δημιουργήσουν την «Εβραϊκή εθνική Εστία» στην Παλαιστίνη.
Εν πάση περιπτώσει, ένας από τους σύμβουλους του Ρίτσαρντ Νίξον, ο Kevin Philipps, αφιέρωσε μια ογκώδη διατριβή για αυτούς τους εμφύλιους πολέμους, και παρατήρησε ότι κανένα από τα προβλήματα δεν επιλύθηκε, και ανακοίνωσε ένα τέταρτο γύρο [ 1 ].
Οι οπαδοί των καλβινιστικών εκκλησιών, που εδώ και 40 χρόνια ψήφιζαν μαζικά για τους Ρεπουμπλικάνους, υποστηρίζουν τώρα τους Δημοκρατικούς.
Δεν αμφιβάλλω ότι η κα Κλίντον θα είναι η επόμενη πρόεδρος των Ηνωμένων Πολιτειών ή ότι αν εκλεχθεί ο κ Τραμπ, θα εξαφανιστεί γρήγορα. Αλλά μέσα σε λίγους μήνες, είμαστε θεατές μιας ευρείας εκλογικής ανακατανομής με φόντο μια μη αναστρέψιμη δημογραφική αλλαγή. Οι εκκλησίες που ανήκουν στους Πουριτανούς δεν αντιπροσωπεύουν παρά το ένα τέταρτο του πληθυσμού και μετατοπίζονται στο στρατόπεδο των Δημοκρατικών. Το μοντέλο τους εμφανίζεται ως ένα ιστορικό ατύχημα. Εξαφανίστηκε ήδη από τη Νότια Αφρική και δεν θα επιβιώσει για πολύ, ούτε στις ΗΠΑ ούτε στο Ισραήλ.
Πέρα από τις προεδρικές εκλογές, η αμερικανική κοινωνία ή θα αλλάξει ή θα έρθει πάλι σε ρήξη. Σε μια χώρα όπου η νεολαία απορρίπτει μαζικά την επιρροή των Πουριτανών ιεροκηρύκων, δεν είναι πλέον δυνατόν να αγνοηθεί το θέμα της ισότητας. Οι Πουριτανοί προσδοκούν σε μια κοινωνία όπου όλοι οι άνθρωποι είναι ίσοι, αλλά όχι ισοδύναμοι. Ο Λόρδος Κρόμγουελ ήθελε μια δημοκρατία (republic) για τους Άγγλους, αλλά μόνο αφού έσφαξε τους παπικούς Ιρλανδούς. Έτσι, σήμερα στις Ηνωμένες Πολιτείες, όλοι οι πολίτες είναι ίσοι ενώπιον του νόμου, αλλά στο όνομα των ίδιων κειμένων, τα δικαστήρια καταδικάζουν συστηματικά μαύρους, ενώ βρίσκουν ελαφρυντικά για τους λευκούς που διαπράττουν παρόμοια εγκλήματα ή αδικήματα. Και στις περισσότερες Πολιτείες, μια ποινική καταδίκη, ακόμα και υπέρβασης ταχύτητας, αρκεί για να αφαιρεθεί το δικαίωμα του εκλέγειν. Ως εκ τούτου, λευκοί και μαύροι είναι ίσοι, αλλά σε ορισμένες πολιτείες, η πλειοψηφία των μαύρων πολιτών έχει στερηθεί νομικά το δικαίωμα του εκλέγειν. Το παράδειγμα αυτής της σκέψης στην εξωτερική πολιτική, είναι η «λύση των δύο Κρατών» στην Παλαιστίνη: ίσα, αλλά προπαντός όχι ισοδύναμα.
Είναι αυτή η πουριτανική σκέψη που οδήγησε τις κυβερνήσεις του πάστορα Κάρτερ, του Ρήγκαν, των Μπους (ο πρεσβύτερος και ο νεώτερος είναι και οι δύο άμεσοι απόγονοι των Πατέρων Προσκυνητών), του Κλίντον και του Ομπάμα να υποστηρίζουν το Ουαχαμπιτισμό σε αντίθεση με τα αναρτημένα ιδανικά της χώρας τους και σήμερα να υποστηρίξουν το Νταές.
Παλαιότερα, οι Πατέρες Προσκυνητές ίδρυσαν κοινότητες στο Plymouth και στη Βοστώνη, οι οποίες έχουν εξιδανικευτεί στην αμερικανική συλλογική μνήμη. Οι ιστορικοί είναι όμως απόλυτοι, έλεγαν ότι αποτελούν το «Νέο Ισραήλ» και επέλεξαν το «Νόμο του Μωυσή». Δεν τοποθέτησαν Σταυρούς στους ναούς τους, αλλά τους Πίνακες του Νόμου. Αν και Χριστιανοί, έδιναν μεγαλύτερη σημασία στις εβραϊκές γραφές παρά στα Ευαγγέλια. Ανάγκαζαν τις γυναίκες τους να καλύψουν το κεφάλι τους με πέπλο και αποκατέστησαν τις σωματικές τιμωρίες.

2f2671ea5d8f11f18b64eee539a79558493e3f2d,0,Thierry Meyssan,2016-10-26T03:00:00.000+03:00,"United States – reformation or fracture?, by Thierry Meyssan","United States – reformation or fracture? by Thierry Meyssan Observing the US presidential electoral campaign, Thierry Meyssan analyses the resurgence of an old and weighty conflict of civilisation. Hillary Clinton has just declared that this election is not about programmes, but about the question «Who are the Americans?». It was not for reasons of his political prgramme that the Republican leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate, Donald Trump, but because of his personal behaviour. According to Thierry Meyssan, until now, the United States was composed of migrants from different horizons who accepted to submit to the ideology of a particular community . This is the model which is in the process of breaking down, at the risk of shattering the country itself.
Voltaire Network | Damascus (Syria) | 26 October 2016 français Español italiano русский Deutsch Português ελληνικά Türkçe عربي During the year of the US electoral campaign that we have just weathered, the rhetoric has profoundly changed, and an unexpected rift has appeared between the two camps. If, in the beginning, the candidates spoke about subjects which were genuinely political (such as the sharing of wealth or national security), today they are mostly talking about sex and money. It is this dialogue, and not the political questions, which has caused the explosion of the Republican party – whose main leaders have withdrawn their support from their candidate - and which is recomposing the political chess-board, awakening an ancient cleavage of civilisation. On one side, Mrs. Clinton is working to appear politically correct, while on the other, «The Donald» is blowing the hypocrisy of the ex-«First Lady» to smithereens.
On one side, Hillary Clinton promises male / female equality - although she has never hesitated to attack and defile the women who revealed that they had slept with her husband – and that she is presenting herself not for her personal qualities, but as the wife of an ex-President, and that she accuses Donald Trump of misogyny because he does not hide his appreciation of the female gender. On the other, Donald Trump denounces the privatisation of the State and the racketing of foreign personalities by the Clinton Foundation to obtain appointments with the State Department – the creation of ObamaCare not in the interest of citizens, but for the profit of medical insurance companies - and goes as far as to question the honesty of the electoral system.
I am perfectly aware that the way in which Donald Trump expresses himself may encourage racism, but I do not believe for a second that this question is at the heart of the electoral debate, despite the hype from the pro-Clinton medias. It is not without interest that, during the Lewinsky affair, President Bill Clinton apologised to the Nation and convened a number of preachers to pray for his salvation. But when he was accused of similar misconduct by an audio recording, Donald Trump simply apologised to the people he had upset without making any appeal to members of the clergy. The currrent divide re-awakens the revolt of Catholic, Orthodox and Lutheran values against those of the Calvinists, mainly represented in the USA by the Presbyterians, the Baptists and the Methodists.
While the two candidates were raised in the Puritan tradition (Clinton as a Methodist and Trump as a Presbyterian), Mrs. Clinton has returned to the religion of her father, and participates today in a prayer group composed of the army chiefs of staff, The Family, while Mr. Trump practises a more interior form of spirituality and rarely goes to church. Of course, no-one is locked into the systems in which they were raised, but when people act without thinking, they unconsciously reproduce these systems. The question of the religious environment of the candidates may therefore be important.
In order to understand the stakes of this game, we have to go back and look at 17th century England. Oliver Cromwell instigated a military coup d’etat which overthrew King Charles 1st. He wanted to install a Republic, purify the soul of the country, and ordered the decapitation of the ex-sovereign. He created a sectarian régime inspired by the ideas of Calvin, massacred thousands of Irish Papists, and imposed a Puritan way of life. He also created Zionism – he invited the Jews back to England, and was the first head of state in the world to demand the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. This bloody episode is known by the name of the «First British Civil War».
After the monarchy had been reinstated, Cromwell’s Puritans fled from England. They set up in Holland, from where some of them left for the Americas aboard the Mayflower (the «Pilgrim Fathers»), while others founded the Afrikaneer community in South Africa. During the War of Independence in the 18th century United States, we saw a resurgence of the struggle of the Calvinists against the British monarchy, so that in current manuals of British History, it is known as the «Second Civil War».
In the 19th century, the American Civil War opposed the Southern States (mainly inhabited by Catholic colonists) to the North (mostly inhabited by Protestant colonists). The History of the winning side presents this confrontation as a fight for freedom in the face of slavery, which is pure propaganda. The Southern states abolished slavery during the war when they concluded an agreement with the British monarchy). As a result, we once again saw the revolt of the Puritans against the Brititsh throne, which is why some historians speak of the «Third British Civil War».
During the 20th century, this interior confrontation of British civilisation seemed over and done with, apart from the re-appearance of the Puritans in the United Kingdom with the «non-conformist Christians» of Prime Minister David Lloyd George. It was they who divided Ireland and agreed to create the « Jewish national homeland» in Palestine.
In any case, one of Richard Nixon’s advisors, Kevin Philipps, dedicated a voluminous thesis to these civil wars, in which he noted that none of the problems had been solved, and announced a fourth confrontation [ 1 ].
The adepts of the Calvinist churches, who for the last 40 years have voted massively for the Republicans, now support the Democrats.
I have no doubt that Mrs. Clinton will be the next President of the United States, or that if Mr. Trump were to be elected, he would be rapidly eliminated. But over the last few months, we have witnessed a large electoral redistribution within an irreversible demographic evolution. The Puritan-based churches now account for only a quarter of the population, and are swinging towards the Democrat camp. Their model looks like a historical accident. It disappeared in South Africa, and will not be able to survive much longer, either in the United States or in Israël. Beyond the Presidential election, US society will have to evolve rapidly or split once again. In a country where the youth massively rejects the influence of the Puritan preachers, it is no longer possible to displace the question of equality. The Puritans envisage a society where all men are equal, but not equivalent. Lord Cromwell wanted a Republic for the English, but only after he had massacred the Irish Papists. This is how it is at the moment in the United States – all citizens are equal before the law, but in the name of the same texts, black people are systematically condemned, while attenuating circumstances are found for white people who have committed equivalent crimes. And in the majority of states, a penal condemnation, even for a speeding ticket, is enough to cancel the right to vote. Consequently, white and black people are equal, but in most states, the majority of black people has been legally deprived of its right to vote. The paradigm of this thought, in terms of foreign policy, is the «two-state» solution in Palestine – equal, but above all, not equivalent.
It is Puritan thinking that led the administrations of preacher Carter, Reagan, Bush (Sr. and Jr. are direct descendants of the Pilgrim Fathers), Clinton and Obama to support Wahhabism, in contradiction to the declared ideals of their countries, and today, to support Daesh.
A long time ago, the Founding Fathers built communities in Plymouth and Boston which were idealised in the US collective memory. And yet the historians are formal – they claimed to be creating the «New Israël», and chose the «Law of Moses». They did not place the Cross in their temples, but the Tables of the Law. Although they are Christians, they attach more importance to the Jewish scriptures than the Gospel. They oblige their women to veil their faces and re-established corporaI punishment. Thierry Meyssan

Kerry","John Kerry’s Remarks at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs by John F. Kerry Voltaire Network | Chicago | 26 October 2016 Well, good evening, everybody. And thank you, very, very much to Ivo Daalder. Thank you, sir, Mr. Ambassador. And thanks to the Chicago Council for Global Affairs for inviting me here. And a profound thank you to Ambassador Lou Susman for his very generous introduction. And most importantly, Marge and Lou, thank you for many, many years of extraordinary friendship. I really value it. And I think everybody is grateful for the service of both of these ambassadors. Thank you.
With respect to my being here, I have to tell you I was surprised that you guys showed up given the Cubbies. (Laughter.) I figured that – I was surprised at the generous welcome, because I thought the only people who would come would be White Sox fans – (applause) – but I’m pleasantly, pleasantly surprised. More to say about that.
Ivo is one of our top foreign policy experts of the generation, and I had the occasion to be at his residence in Brussels with President Karzai and the then chief of staff of Pakistan’s armed forces, and we abused his premises significantly for hours while we negotiated. But I’m grateful for the job he did. He was an outstanding United States ambassador to NATO.
And Lou, folks, if you don’t know it, is a Chicago fixture. He is a former emissary to the United Kingdom to the Court of St. James, a lawyer, a businessman, and as I mentioned, a longtime friend. He is also one of those very irritating people who no matter what he tries he succeeds at it. (Laughter.)
So Ambassador Daalder and Susman, you guys make a great team. And my deepest respects to you, and thank you for continuing with the council in providing leadership. We really appreciate it.
To my former colleague on Capitol Hill, Senator Dick Durbin, to Secretary Bill Daley, to Ambassador Jim Dobbins, members of the consular corps, and to all of you, thank you very much for your warm welcome to Chicago, the hometown of my boss. (Applause.)
I’m not saying this for your consumption; I say it anywhere and everywhere. President Obama is going to go down in history as one of America’s significant and most accomplished chief executives. (Applause.) And lucky guy, he’s only in his fifties. He’s got a lot more to contribute to the country, so we’re all lucky.
And over the years, I have heard President Obama talk a lot about Chicago, as you could imagine. And I am sure he has heard me as a champion of Boston complaining about Chicago’s unconscionable kidnapping of Theo Epstein and Jon Lester. (Laughter.) Envy is a terrible thing, folks. (Laughter.)
We all know that for many decades, Boston and Chicago were linked by an evil curse hatched by demons dwelling thousands of miles beneath the Earth’s crust. (Laughter.) And a dozen years ago, with Theo’s help, Boston broke from the spell. And skies opened, the lotus blossoms fell like rain. (Laughter.) And because some of you may be superstitious – which actually means all of you are superstitious – I will say no more except to say: Forget about yesterday. Your Cubbies are wicked awesome, as we say in Boston. (Applause.) And I promise to get you home tonight before the seventh inning stretch. (Laughter.)
Now, my focus this evening is on diplomacy, the art of negotiating and building relationships. It is a skill that some people have and others do not. For example, when Ulysses S. Grant was a boy, he lived across the state in Galina. And at the age of eight, he got permission from his dad to buy a neighbor’s horse. So he went to the neighbor’s farm and he told the guy there, “Papa says I can offer you $20 for the colt, but if you don’t take it, I’m to offer twenty-two-and-a-half. And if you don’t take that, I’m to give you 25.”
Now, my friends, with that kind of transparency, we could put WikiLeaks out of business. (Laughter.) But I’ve got to tell you, it makes you wonder how the North ever won the Civil War. (Laugher.) Now, we can all read about the Civil War and have, and we can all sit in the grandstands and watch the World Series, but actually, we’re here tonight not as spectators. We’re here as real-life participants in a troubled world. And we know that we have choices to make as citizens and as a country that can spell the difference between security and suffering, progress and stagnation, in an era of rapid, breathtaking transition. And that breathtaking transition is at the heart of a lot of the discontent that we see playing out in the most disturbing and unattractive ways.
But we have to take seriously what’s underneath it. The stark and bipolar divide of the Cold War that I encountered when I first arrived in the United States Senate that I grew up with, as a kid who grew up through the Cold War, but which I arrived at in the Senate more than 30 years ago, that bipolar, simple world has disappeared, and I don’t think anyone regrets that. But we are confronted today by a globe that is both no less dangerous and far more complex, where the power to influence events is less hierarchical, far more broadly dispersed, and change is at least as likely to be driven from the bottom as it is from the top.
For better and often for worse, non-state actors have assumed a more prominent role on the global stage. Chicago’s MacArthur Foundation is one of the happier examples. And the astonishing march of technology has and continues to revolutionize the workplace, and seemingly it has shrunk time and space, and that makes neighbors of all of us. Political instability, economic hardships, and even climate change have caused record numbers of people to migrate across borders in search of a better life. And all of this has made the job of governing in a way that meets public expectations harder than it has ever been before.
Here in the United States, we saw our nation attacked on 9/11 and our armed forces enter a fight at great cost in Afghanistan and Iraq. In recent years, we have witnessed the rise of Daesh/ISIL and again experienced the tragedy of terrorist murders close to home. We are confronted as well by the specter of cyber warfare, and by the unwelcome return of vicious sectarian violence and extreme nationalism.
It is little wonder that some yearn for what seems like a far simpler time. But it would be foolish to think that we can move ahead with our eyes firmly fixed on the rearview mirror. International challenges can’t be wished away, they can’t be ignored. They have to be met with honesty and determination and confidence. And that is the approach that our country at its best has always taken. As a famous son of Illinois once said, “optimist” is just another name for an American. And I agree – on at least this point – with Ronald Reagan. (Laughter.)
Put simply, the tasks that we face in the world today are more diverse and more complicated than those that our predecessors wrestled with. And frankly, our strategies have to reflect that and they don’t always. Some problems are relatively narrow in scope or they’re confined to a particular region, but a few – such as those that are posed by poor governance, of which there is far too much in this world right now – corruption, climate change, violent extremism; these are problems and challenges that are literally generational in their scope, and they require both short-term and long-term actions – something that our politics is finding it really difficult to deal with to our great detriment as a country.
At times we will be able to count on global institutions, but more often we’re going to have to do a lot of the heavy lifting ourselves. That’s what I’ve learned as Secretary. In every case, we have to act with our nation’s values and our best interests in mind. And I want to be crystal clear that is exactly what we are doing.
Now, we’ve all heard some people accuse the United States of standing aloof from the world’s problems or somehow being in retreat. I’ve heard that narrative. I hear people say why is the United States disengaging? Why are you pulling back? And I scratch my head, and I say, where are these people coming from? But those assertions are, to use a diplomatic term of art, absolute nonsense. The truth is that the United States today is more deeply engaged in more places simultaneously on more critical issues with greater consequence than ever before in the history of this nation, and I know that. (Applause.)
Now, let me run through that a little bit so it’s not just a sentence, it’s not rhetoric. Consider for a moment the world’s most dynamic region.
The Asia Pacific is essential to the security and the prosperity of the United States – period. Of our top ten trading partners in the world, five of them are in Asia. The globe’s most populous country and its largest democracy are located there. In East Asia, we have enduring defense alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea that we continue to strengthen and reaffirm and that we have strengthened and reaffirmed in this administration twice since I have been Secretary.
We have a regional diplomatic agenda that covers everything from nonproliferation to the prevention of human trafficking. Just two days ago I chaired – because I chair the Interagency Task Force – we had the Attorney General of the United States, the head of the FBI, the Treasury Department, the entire government – Education Department, Commerce – all at the same table talking about how we’re going to deal with human trafficking and end the scourge of modern-day slavery in the year 2016. I don’t know any other nation. (Applause.) You tell me what other nation has every arm of its government sitting around the same table on the same day wrestling with a global international issue and offering leadership as we have been on the issue of trafficking. Young women who are sold into slavery and sex traffics; a young man with a shackle around his neck that The New York Times chronicled so effectively, who was two years at sea, shackled to a boat where he was made to fish illegally and as a slave. You can run through 27 million stories, folks. I don’t know them all, but I know that each is as horrible as the other, and so do you. And these are people who are powerless; people from whom it is only a country like us that is willing to work to try to stand up and bring them out of the shadows and liberate them that we are their only hope, their only possibility of survival in situations where otherwise they might be forgotten to anybody and everybody – a speck of history that disappeared in some horrible moment that we don’t even witness.
We are cooperating with local (inaudible) leaders to restrain North Korea’s dangerous nuclear program and we’re adding muscle to one of the toughest economic sanctions regimes ever imposed, and we led the effort to achieve that. We consult regularly with regional partners to prevent misunderstandings that would lead to even greater tensions in the South China Sea. And we are helping to guide Myanmar’s historic transition from global outcast to emerging democracy. Just yesterday, I met with leaders from Vietnam to deepen our ties to a one-time adversary with whom we have found areas of common ground that not long ago would have seemed literally unimaginable.
Yesterday, I sat across a man who told me he fought in Quang Tri in the north of Vietnam while I was in the south, improbable as it might have been years ago for me to imagine we would sit across the table from each other and talk about how we really make peace. We left there in 1975 – as you all know, ’73 – we left in ’75, the fall of Saigon, then-Saigon, and the rest is history. Well, I’m proud that the United States saw the President of the United States Barack Obama, together with the Secretary of State who fought in that war in Hanoi, in Ho Chi Minh City, forging stronger ties with what is now a raging capitalist country that is changing rapidly. And that is how you really make peace, my friends – by building, by diplomacy. (Applause.)
In September, I sat down with New York – in New York with representatives from many Asian nations, and they reiterated a message that I have heard over and over again as Secretary of State. They welcome America’s presence in their region. And they don’t go to bed at night wondering about when we’re going to leave; they worry that we might leave. They don’t want any one country to try and dictate to others what they can and cannot do. And they see the United States of America as a balancing and stabilizing force, but they’re also concerned about what the future is going to bring. And the question they ask, the critical test of our commitment above all others, is whether we will formally approve the Trans Pacific Partnership or the TPP.
Now, let me tell you, this 12-nation agreement which we sought, which we led to create, which we have put our credibility on the line in order to build this 40 percent of global GDP entity that will create a race to the top, not a race to the bottom. It’s a global economy, and this agreement includes three of the biggest trading partners of Chicago – Canada, Mexico, and Japan. Unlike any trade agreement that our country has ever previously signed, TPP includes unprecedented labor and environmental protections within the four corners of the agreement, unlike the others. It mandates a level playing field between private sector companies and state-owned companies. Who do you think benefits from that? We don’t have state-owned companies. Other countries do. And now we create a level playing field. And provided Congress approves it, this pact will abolish 18,000 foreign taxes on American goods and services, making it easier for our farmers, our ranchers, and our businesspeople to be able to export overseas.
That is why the TPP is both a good deal for the American economy and it is a litmus test of our country’s capacity to lead. Make no mistake; if we’re going to live up to our responsibilities in Asia, if we’re going to treat our partners with the respect that they deserve while earning their respect at the same time, and if we’re going to do what is necessary to protect our interests, we have to maintain a steady and a reliable presence in that region. And I’ll just share with you our involvement can’t be in one sector and not in others. We can’t focus on one country and not be inclusive. We can’t focus on security at one moment and then ignore the economic dimension. You can’t turn it on and off like a faucet. Whenever and wherever vacuums exist in this world today, others will move to fill them in ways that may not embrace the rule of law and that will certainly not reflect the kind of high trading standards that we, the United States, seek.
If we were to see the TPP rejected, it would be a gigantic self-inflicted wound on our nation – a setback to our own interests in the region, where our credibility as a country on any agreement we’re trying to negotiate would be in doubt. It would amount to a conscious turning of our backs on the Asia Pacific at the very moment that we ought to be linking arms. It would be an act that would hurt American workers, slow our economy, hinder our ability to advance the full range of U.S. objectives in a region that is just, by common sense, with five of the fastest-growing nations in the world, a region that is important to our future.
Now, the good news is most of our citizens realize this. A recent survey by this council showed that a majority of Americans favor the TPP and believe that free trade is beneficial – and as I say free, I say fair, because it’s important that it be an agreement like the TPP, where you have labor standards and environment standards. But it is beneficial to our economy and is helpful to America’s standard of living.
And those people who are the majority in America who say they do support it realize that if America is going to keep growing – just think about this, it’s sort of basic common sense. You want the economy to grow, folks? Then you have to be able to sell to the places where 95 percent of the world’s customers live, and that’s not in the United States. Ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live in other countries – beyond our borders – and we can’t grow our economy unless we’re willing to engage in trade. So don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. That’s not what this is about. The problem is not that the average American worker is penalized by trade itself. The average American worker is penalized by a system that doesn’t allow them to share in the benefits of that trade, which sees the top 1 percent take most of the benefits away with them. And what we need is a measure of fairness in our tax structure, in our social structure, education, ongoing education, that provides opportunity for all Americans, so that whatever disruption or dislocation might come is adjusted for because we understand what we’re doing.
So I call on Congress when it returns to Washington after the election to take up and approve the TPP. It is the right thing to do for America – and no matter what the loudest voices may be shouting – it is also the popular choice. (Applause.)
Now even – but even as we demonstrate sustained leadership on the rebalance of our national security policy towards the Asia Pacific, we have to confront a lot of other tests as well. And none is more urgent than responding to the threat that is posed by violent extremists. This is a danger that has evolved steadily since 9/11 and we work constantly to defend against it, both here and at home; and in helping Nigeria to push back against the terrorist kidnappers of Boko Haram, which we are doing successfully; of helping Somalia to reclaim land from al-Shabaab, which we are doing successfully; of helping Afghanistan to safeguard its citizens from the Taliban; to help friends in the Middle East who are confronted by the most ruthless terrorist organization of all.
I want you to think back to the summer of 2014, ask yourself who is retreating. In 2014, Daesh terrorists were rampaging across Syria and Iraq, and you remember seeing on TV the Toyotas and the black flags and the sweeping columns moving through town after town plundering cities, murdering and torturing the innocent, and claiming to establish a caliphate that would rule all Islam. We heard dire predictions that Baghdad was about to fall and that young people from every single corner of the globe were going to flock to Daesh to kill and die in the name of hate.
It was a time to provide leadership, and that is exactly what President Obama did when he ordered U.S. planes to engage and bomb those terrorists and help rescue an endangered group of Yazidis on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, where we stopped a slaughter from taking place. We led the effort to mobilize a diverse coalition that now numbers 67 countries. And together with our partners on the ground, we took on the terrorists and began to liberate the cities that they had occupied – Kobani, Tikrit, Fallujah, Ramadi, and more. And today, the citizens who were driven out have returned to those communities. Day after day, we have been eliminating the leaders of Daesh, choking their finances, disrupting their supply lines, hammering their oil facilities, and reducing their recruitment to a trickle.
And from the outset, we warned that eliminating Daesh completely wasn’t going to happen overnight; it was going to take a number of years. And that remains the case. But I’m telling you, the terrorists haven’t been able to launch a significant offensive and hold territory since May of last year. We have closed off the strategic border between Syria and Turkey.
And just last week, Iraqi and Peshmerga forces began a campaign to free Mosul, the so-called spiritual capital of Daesh’s phony caliphate and its largest remaining stronghold. Now this is going to be a difficult and consuming assault against a dug-in foe; but I’ll tell you this, our resolve could not be more firm. Daesh is opposed to every value human civilization aspires to. Daesh kills Christians because they are Christians; Jews because they are Jews; Yazidis because they are Yazidis; Shiite Muslims because they are Shiite Muslims; and Sunni Muslims if they reject Daesh’s ugly view of the world. Daesh sells little girls into slavery and brags about it. It cuts off the heads of innocent people in public, and sometimes forces children to watch and to even participate in executions. I said it earlier this year and I will say it again: Daesh is guilty of genocide and we will hold Daesh accountable. (Applause.)
My friends, it matters that every time we defeat these terrorists in one place, we seize files that help us to disrupt the networks that they are trying to establish in others; we learn more about how Daesh operates and who is aiding or conspiring with them. No one hears much about the attacks that don’t happen. We’re glad; we like it that way. But by sharing information, our coalition is helping to deter and break up plots on a regular basis before anyone gets hurt.
We are also engaged in a nonstop effort to rebut the lies that fuel propaganda. Here, too, we are making gains. Daesh’s presence on social media has plummeted and it has become apparent that its pledge to create Paradise on Earth is crumbling into a hand full of dust.
So here’s the bottom line: Because of the determined use of our diplomacy backed by our armed forces and the commitment of our partners, and the leadership that we have provided, we are going to win the fight against Daesh. And we are going to prevail without altering the nature of our societies, without succumbing to bigotry, without closing our borders, without betraying the democratic values that terrorists have vowed to destroy.
We will also persist in our effort to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria, and I believe we will find a way to ultimately end the most severe humanitarian crisis since World War II. It is a crisis, I might add, that is not going to be solved by just writing checks for refugees. We’re the largest donor in the world to the Syrian refugees. But what we have to do is stop the flow of refugees; we have to end the war. And this is as complicated a bit of diplomatic business as I’ve ever seen.
The situation in Syria is made worse by the multi-sided nature of the fighting as well as the utter depravity of the Assad regime, and there are so many different forces there. But precisely because the war is so complex, clear principles are required to end it. And because some outside powers have been playing an unhelpful role, international cooperation is essential as well. That’s why a year ago, we, the United States, brought together a group of stakeholders – the International Syria Support Group. It includes every single country that is involved in the conflict, including Russia and Iran.
And some people say, “Well, why are you sitting at the table with those guys?” Because they’re involved. Because without them being part of the solution, they are part of the problem. Each and every one of those countries promised to support a cessation of hostilities, the unfettered delivery of humanitarian aid, and negotiations that would lead to a political transition. Now, these remain the right principles for ending the war; but as the world knows far too well, the promises made on paper have not yet been matched by actions on the ground.
And this failure to keep faith has been both deeply tragic and unbelievably frustrating, piling misery on top of misery, and squandering opportunities for progress when they’re staring us right in the face. And despite the many setbacks, my friends, there’s a simple reality. The need for diplomacy remains, because the fact remains that a military solution in the judgment of most people is simply not possible – at least not if Syria is ever to be a whole country again.
This is complicated because there are many wars taking place simultaneously in the same place – Kurd on Kurd, Kurd on Turkey, Iran versus Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia versus Iran; Iran and Hizballah versus Israel versus us and those who have labeled Hizballah a terrorist organization; a lot of people against Assad; the whole world against Daesh; Daesh against Assad and civilization and everybody else; Shia versus Sunni; Persian Shia versus Arab Sunni. I think that’s more than six.
So let me be clear: There’s nothing inevitable about this war. The Syrian disaster resulted from choices that people made. And what people have the power to choose, they have the ability to change. I don’t think it’s hard to envision the changes that we need: a real and lasting ceasefire, representatives from both sides coming together in Geneva and coming together in the country, coming together in the country to defeat the terrorists and coming together in Geneva to define the transitional governing body of the Geneva Communique; to agree on new leadership and on new forms of governance; and to prepare for elections.
And why can I say that? Because every single country at the table of the International Syria Support Group has said they support that – elections, a transition government, a whole Syria, respect for rights of all minorities, secular, non-sectarian. The problem is there remains a mountain of mistrust between where we are and where we need to get to. And as we try to chip away at that mountain, we will make – I will make and President Obama will make zero apology for using every single diplomatic tool at our disposal to try to end this war. And we make no apology for not giving up when hospitals are being bombed, when children are still dying in the streets, and more and more refugees are added to the most horrific mass exodus in modern times. We owe the world our best effort to end this war, and we will continue to provide it. (Applause.)
Now, the impact of our diplomacy is also being felt in Europe, which is in the process of responding to an array of economic and other dilemmas, including the influx of refugees from Syria, from the Middle East, from Afghanistan, from Africa, and the decision, of course, by Great Britain to leave the European Union.
And we take these concerns very seriously, but they don’t diminish our faith in the future of the European project or the resilience of the transatlantic relationship partnership. I was in Brussels earlier this month, and I found that the sense of common purpose across the Atlantic is being demonstrated every single day. The United States and Europe continue to maintain tough economic sanctions against Russia because of its aggression in Ukraine, and our unity has been made even stronger by Russian President Putin’s repeated efforts to interfere in the functioning of our democratic systems. In July, at the NATO Summit in Warsaw, we agreed to bolster our security efforts in the Baltics and in Central Europe, and we’re doing that. We’re emphasizing energy diversification, helping to lead countries that have a one-place energy source and try to diversify for them in order to avoid the potential of being exposed to economic blackmail. And as I’ve said clearly on both sides of the English Channel: Brexit does not alter in the least American’s unwavering commitment to a strong Europe, a strong United Kingdom, and close diplomatic cooperation on matters of importance to all of us.
One illustration of that kind of diplomatic cooperation was the nuclear agreement that was referred to in Lou’s introduction regarding Iran. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action would never have gotten off the ground without firm European support for the sanctions that helped to bring Iran to the bargaining table. And that support was critical because before negotiations began, Iran had developed the ability to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb in just two months. In fact, they had enough nuclear material for 12 bombs. That’s where we were. The clock was ticking. So we made the decision to negotiate, and it is a good thing we did.
Under the plan that we reached, Iran agreed to ship 98 percent of its enriched uranium out of the country, to shut down two-thirds of its centrifuges, to take the core of its plutonium nuclear reactor and fill it with concrete rendering it unusable forever, and they acceded to a state-of-the-art, rigorous verification regime.
Now, as we know, this was a contentious debate here in this country. Many people argued against negotiating with Iran, let alone coming to an agreement, saying it would be a terrible mistake. I’ll tell you, to my core, I still believe they were and are wrong. The Iran agreement wasn’t a miscalculation. It has made the whole world safer, and it shows the value of diplomatic engagement even – and perhaps especially – when the governments involved disagree with another on as many issues as we did. When we came together to begin this negotiation, we hadn’t even talked formally to an official of Iran in 35 years.
Now, I’m not standing here pretending to you that diplomacy can solve every problem. It can’t. But the peaceful breakthroughs that it can provide are well worth the attempt. Nothing has ever been accomplished by an unwillingness to try. And I’ve always said I’d rather be caught trying.
Our diplomacy is also making a difference on global issues, and at the top of that is the historic progress that we are now beginning to make with regard to climate change.
Here in Chicago, as elsewhere around the world, you’ve experienced record high temperatures. If the present trend continues, average thermometer readings in the Midwest are going to reach those traditionally associated with the deep South. Each last month was the hottest month in human history – July the hottest month in recorded history. May, June, run the list – so much so that the last 10 years add to the fact that not only was last year the hottest year in human history, the last 10 years are the hottest year – or the hottest decade. And guess what? The decade before that is the second-hottest in human history, and the decade before that is the third-hottest in human history. You’d think with those trend lines that everybody would catch on. But in fact, we had a political party in our country that didn’t allow – not one single candidate running for president – to say anything about climate change. And in the debates that we just had for president, out of six hours of debates, the vice president and president combined, not one single question was asked about climate change.
Now, here in Chicago, you’ve been responding to this challenge by implementing flood protection measures, by planting trees, by committing to green technology. But for these steps to be fully effective, they’re going to have to be matched by a concerted international campaign that is now, because of our efforts, gathering steam. And no one country can solve this problem alone. If we went to zero tomorrow, we’d still have a major problem.
Last December in Paris, the United States joined governments from nearly 200 nations in approving the most far-reaching agreement on climate change ever negotiated. And to arrive at that point, we had to put the environment where it belonged: right at the top or near top of our foreign policy agenda.
In 2009 in Copenhagen – I remember being there – the world convened to talk about climate change but adjourned in total disarray, a famous implosion where the Chinese were involved with the G77 in moving in the opposite direction. So recognizing that, one of my first initiatives as Secretary of State was to prevent that from happening again. I went to Beijing to create in the early – within a month and a half or so of being Secretary, we created a bilateral working group in order to see if it was possible for us to find a different way to move forward with the exact purpose of trying to have our presidents be able to announce the level of reductions that we would jointly engage in.
Well, that effort paid off when, in January of 2015, President Obama and President Xi stood side by side in Beijing, representing the world’s two largest economies and the two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, and together we set ambitious targets for action while encouraging other countries to do the same. That is what broke open the possibility of the Paris Agreement.
And the Paris Agreement was a diplomatic milestone, but it’s still far from the finish line. We began this year hoping to take additional strides. First, we wanted to ensure that enough countries would formally ratify the Paris Agreement so that we could bring it into force by the end of the year. That required a whirlwind effort to gain the approval of cabinets and parliaments, the kind of",english,2016-10-28T21:17:34.131+03:00,voltairenet.org,US,48413,"John Kerry's Remarks at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, by John F.

No event in American history (if you ask me) has been more engineered, more anticipated and more built up than the upcoming November 8, 2016 presidential election. Face it. This presidential election season made the truth movement mainstream. Evil and corruption was brought into the light. We’ve observed what a George Soros-like engineered regime breakdown looks and feels like from the inside, our side this time. We had heard and read about all those foreign governments that the US overthrew with their “democracy” tactics using “special forces,” NGOs, paid-for revolutionaries, activists and in some cases flat-out murderous fighters (ISIS, moderate rebels). This time the engineered chaos was happening here in the US. 
This 2016 election season has been packed with outright exposed corruption, lies, propaganda, murders, stolen primaries, fabricated accusations, distractions, staged debates and much more. We have seen a criminally accused presidential candidate get away with crimes in broad daylight while suspected of suffering from Parkinson’s disease, passing out, having seizures and even being followed around by a creepy doctor with a seizure medication injector. This is the stuff Hollywood films are made of. The list of the insanity goes on and on, right? We’ve witnessed plenty of lies, propaganda and Jerry Springer Show -like attacks by the candidates to create just the perfect smokescreen so that Americans are not looking into the events in Aleppo or Mosul much less the Hillary-DNC- mainstream media corruption scandals and revelations. 
Instead of keeping a close eye on the doings of the US criminal empire, the elite relied on a very in-your-face and increasingly arrogant, defiant and now very busted and discredited mainstream media to push the desired paradigm and reinforce it every which way they can. Actually, this understates the situation. What really happened was that the mainstream media joined forces with the chosen candidate of the ruling oligarchs (Hillary) and together their campaign (the DNC-Hillary-Soros-Moveon.org-Michael Moore-Hollywood-mainstream media complex) has brought us to the ending that truth seekers are now looking ahead to with great anxiety and anticipation. Actually, I’m understating the situation again. All or most Americans (awakened or not) are anticipating and anxiously awaiting the end results of the US presidential elections. 
The question we should all be asking then is, how did we get here? Oh, and perhaps more importantly, where are we going? To answer this, one must realize that the ruling elite have plans. They have a lot of money and they have players willing to go along with their plans. Not sure of this? Then please research Sandy Hook or Boston bombing events. Or research many of the crisis actor events of the past few years. 
That’s right. While they were staging one event after another, too many Americans were too busy and too afraid to call these fake events for what they were. Too many Americans fell for the trick that we were supposed to believe mainstream media “stories” and narratives unless we could “prove” that the account didn’t happen the way mainstream media said it did. In other words, many Americans were tricked into believing that, unless proven otherwise, we should BELIEVE mainstream media. Well here we are in October of 2016 and finally (though it has been common knowledge to many of us for a long while) the illegitimacy of the mainstream media is carved in stone. No longer can it be considered a “conspiracy” by anyone, that mainstream media is corrupt and acts as a tool of psychological terrorism against the public on behalf of the ruling elite. 
That said, now it is time to confront the fully engineered and long-planned ending of this 2016 US presidential election. Will staged “ political terrorism, ” a term just introduced a couple of weeks ago into the American psyche, be staged as Mike Adams at Natural News is writing about ? Will this “terrorism” or planned “event” mark the beginning of the end of America? If so, what will happen? How will it all go down? Many are now wondering how deep is this web of corruption and how far will the traitors identified before us be willing to go to destroy America? 
The one thing everyone should accept is that this ending has been planned just like so many “events” of the past several years have been scripted and planned. So today I invite readers to acknowledge this very important singular factor in today’s events. The fact that they are planned. The notion of organic and spontaneous results is something the ruling elite hate. They hate anything that is organic, spontaneous, unpredictable, people-powered, natural and real. They need everything to be controlled, scripted, planned, orchestrated, engineered. Do you see a pattern here? One consciousness longs for freedom, naturalness and spontaneity, the other longs to control, orchestrate, engineer and dictate the ending, like a master would want to control his slave. 
Understanding this fundamental contrast between the control-freak consciousness (think ruling elite) and the free-spirited consciousness, will allow you to see what’s coming this November 8th 2016. What’s coming is a long-awaited day for which the ruling elite have paid a lot of money and hired many people to manipulate and control the ending of. So the real question is, will their operation succeed? Looking at the election day ending from a bird’s-eye view and seeing how the ruling elite think and operate it is not difficult to see that they, too, are waiting for that day so that they can implement whatever plan they’ll need based on the materializing reality at that moment. In this (what I’ll call) wait-and-see plan whose execution will either be entirely controlled from the beginning or be an adjusting reaction-based plan to be determined by the emerging reality, we can be sure that at no point will the ruling elite accept an ending that ruins their plan. In other words, they will adjust their plan as often and as desperately as possible and necessary to engineer an ending to their liking. 
This ultimately is all we need to know to plan our (truth seekers and freedom lovers) next move. And our next move should look something like this if you ask me: 
1- Have a plan including options for self-sustaining yourself and your loved ones (food, water, shelter and other personal needs). 
2- Expect corruption but continue fighting and exposing the perpetrators. Let’s not let one of these traitors (including crisis actors and operatives working for the State) get away with what they have done. 
3- Don’t rely ONLY on the Internet to keep track of developing events. You might want to write down current event information, or better yet print out key articles and documents (proof). Also download important videos; don’t assume these videos will always be available on YouTube or the Internet. Remember we are entering a much more volatile and intense information war age. The main point is we need to archive the evidence against those criminals who have betrayed America and humanity. 
4- Beware of layered psychological operations. Question everything you hear and don’t discount that some “news” is designed for you to hear it (get it?). Unfortunately the controllers have indeed upped the ante when it comes to the information war. In deceptive times like these, grabbing on to the principles you believe in become much more important than agreeing with someone on every little nuance about a particular event. Stay oriented and remember who the bad guys are, especially as we see the Hillary-mainstream media complex laughably blaming Russian president Vladimir Putin for all the now-revealed corruption and criminality of the Clintons, the mainstream media, the DNC and many others. 
Now is the time to confront the very real and very relevant inherent concepts of truth versus lies, lightness versus darkness, freedom versus slavery and knowledge versus hidden knowledge (the occult); because this, my friends, is what we are dealing with. We (truth seekers) are all in this together. We didn’t ask to be put in this show, it sort of came to us. Perhaps we (awakened humanity) are fulfilling a role that we cannot fully understand. This species we call humans needs some members of its kind to save the rest of the species, and if you are reading this then you are probably a chosen vessel in this battle for humanity. 
There is nothing to fear, for the ending has surely been scripted. We (like them) will also respond in real-time in the most effective way possible. What we need to do more than anything else is …. (pay attention) … think ahead just like they do. 
And so today I’m thinking ahead. I have plans for both scenarios (Trump or Hillary declared victory). I have plans for no “political terrorism” and political terrorism, shock or no shock, chaos or no chaos. In my world the problem remains the same until we hold these corrupt ruling elite, their politicians and players all responsible for their criminality and corruption. Plain and simple, the ruling elite must be identified, stopped and held accountable for their crimes against humanity and the US Constitution. This is more important than any presidential election. Will a Trump victory make this accountability more possible? Many are hopeful of this, but ultimately we must find a way to impose our will on the future and not rely on a politician to do this for us. 
Finally, I’m reminded of the very last line of the film The American Dream when the villain asks, “What do you think this is?” and the answer: “This is AMERICA!!” Likewise, let’s remember, this IS America, the politically hijacked land that guarantees each and every individual inherent rights which are clearly and indisputably outlined in the US Constitution. Will an opportunity present itself for the rule of law to be restored or will the ruling elite have their way? That question will very likely be answered at a time not necessarily coinciding with election night. This is a reminder to all that the battle we face for humanity and truth is continuous and very long term, not about one isolated moment or day. About the Author

A COUNTY Waterford man is currently undergoing psychiatric treatment today after he was unable to get over the amount of ‘kids’ in a local night club last night. 
Michael Roache, 43, is said to be suffering from a rare form of temporary psychosis, which forces him to repeat himself continually for its duration. 
“It started after he arrived home last night,” wife Deirdre Roache recalls, “I thought nothing of it until this morning, when I found him staring at the ceiling in bed, murmuring the same thing over and over again: ‘I can’t get over the amount of kids in here'”. 
Worried, the mother of children immediately called her local care doctor, who in turn referred him to a psychiatric unit for further testing. 
It is understood the self-employed man was overwhelmed when he entered the popular nightclub in the city centre, triggering something in his head and sending him into a loop. 
“He kept saying over and over again that he couldn’t get over the amount of kids in the place,” friend Dermot Ryan told WWN, who is also way too old for night clubs, “We just went in for a late drink because we were working late. It’ll be the last time I go into that fucking place. I felt so old”.

IT HAS come to our attention that there is quite a lot of tension building up between the world superpowers with many reputable news publications like the Daily Mail, Irish Mirror and the World Weekly News hinting at a third instalment of the planet’s World War series. In lieu of this fact, we have carefully compiled a handy guide for world leaders to follow in a bid to prevent such a sequel: 
First thing a world superpower should do if they want to avoid such a mess, is spend half the country’s entire annual revenue on ‘military stuff’. After all, you can’t prevent a world war unless you have your cards in the game, right? Sure, there maybe millions of people starving in your country, rising racial tensions you need to address, and health care that needs supporting, but none of that makes any sense if you don’t spend that 600 billion dollars on war preventing things, like nuclear warheads and helmets. 
To end any possible conflict, every good leader knows that strategically placing missile bases on the perimeter of your rival nation is the first step to peace. Run drill after drill along their border to show them that you too are also willing to solve this crisis in a reasonable and mature manner. This is key to abating any World War. NOTE: Best done in a former country owned by your rival. 
As a spokesperson of a large country full of millions of people, communication between your nation and the other is key. Daily news publications should by now be your best bet as you try and reason with the other side. Let thousands of sensible journalists do the negotiating for you with a series of well written and researched articles outlining why it is that war is a terrible idea. Put your absolute trust in their foresight and ability to word certain scenarios correctly. Never question the editors of such publications as they know better than you, and most of all, never ever hold a journalist responsible for the pieces they write. These people are your greatest ally when preventing war. Just leave them to it. 
If things get really heated, send a flotilla of naval vessels past your oppositions coastline. They’ll get your sense of humour and will love you more for it. Invade one of the old countries you used to own. Show them that you think just like them. Fly some bombers into their airspace. After all, aren’t we all the same at the end of the day? 
The final and most important thing in preventing a war is to showcase your military muscle on a proxy nation that has nothing to do with anything you, or your rival nation is doing. Use the moment to show them, and the entire world, the sophisticated products of your military spend. Try and entice your foe into doing the same. Call it: a practice run, dick measuring contest, fighting ISIS, whatever the fuck you like. Just make sure to stack up those innocent dead and mutilated bodies like they did in the good old days of WW I & WWII, and blame it on the other side. That should stop this whole bloody mess.",english,2016-10-26T22:37:31.762+03:00,waterfordwhispersnews.com,US,58305,WWN Guide To Preventing World War III,0,http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/wallpaper_world_in_conflict_soviet_assault_03_2560x1600.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

SWIRLING rumours in one Waterford homestead suggest that Tramore woman and local aunt Deirdre Collane’s latest boyfriend may be ‘the one’. 
In a dramatic unveiling ceremony, Deirdre is believed to have presented Danny Mondran to her older sister, her brother-in-law and her 4 nieces and nephews and declared they were getting on so well she wouldn’t be surprised if they were married sometime next year in Spain, in a church she definitely hadn’t already picked out. 
Not wanting to speak too soon or ‘jinx it’, Deirdre tentatively suggested Mondran, her 14th boyfriend of the 2016 dating season, was likely to be the one, her future husband and mother of her 5 children named Daniel Jr, Ciara, Colm, Eoin and Ella. 
“More like future ex-husband,” Deirdre’s brother-in-law Martin whispered under his breath, not helping matters at all. 
Citing two dates they had gone reasonably well and a half remembered and drunken conversation about ‘wanting kids’ the 36-year-old school teacher was happy to report she had ‘called off the search’, much to the confusion of Daniel, who could have sworn Deirdre said they were going to the cinema and not to her sister’s house for a sit down meal. 
“I thought Graham was your boyfriend,” said one of Deirdre’s nieces, veering wildly off a carefully worded script provided to her by her mother, Elaine, as part of an effort to ensure one of Deirdre’s triggers weren’t activated. 
For his part, Daniel smiled politely and engaged in small talk as part of what he was almost sure was his last ever date with Deirdre.",english,2016-10-26T22:37:31.855+03:00,waterfordwhispersnews.com,US,58305,Local Aunt’s 14th New Boyfriend This Year Probably ‘The One’,0,http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shutterstock_256154812-e1477492126177.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

UK POLICE have renewed their appeal for any information as to the whereabouts of a French national who was reported missing in the Manchester area of the country in August, WWN can reveal. 
“Paul Pogba was last seen in Turin and believed to have boarded a plane to Manchester to start a new job, but his employers reported he failed to turn up to work in August. We are renewing our appeal for anyone with information to come forward,” Met officer John Goodwin shared as part of the appeal. 
Officers would not be drawn on the rumours that the man had robbed his employers of his salary and signing on bonus before disappearing. 
“Paul also answers to ‘Pog’ and in addition to being able to play in all variety of positions he would be easily identified by his haircut, which looks like it was done by a blind man with a great sense of humour,” officer Goodwin added. 
Police hope that with his employers Manchester United being back in the headlines recently following a mixed run of form, they can use the publicity surrounding it to find Paul safe and sound. 
“Just come home, Paul,” Pogba’s emotional manager Jose Mourinho urged as part of the renewed search appeal. 
One of the UK’s most intriguing missing persons inquiry ever, Mr. Pogba’s absence has sparked what experts have called mass hallucinations as members of the public claim to have seen him on television on multiple occasions. 
Police hopes were dashed last week when they rushed to London’s Chelsea area last Sunday after sightings of the man were reported but a search of the location proved otherwise.",english,2016-10-26T22:37:32.074+03:00,waterfordwhispersnews.com,US,58305,UK Police Continue Search For Missing Paul Pogba,0,http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shutterstock_483840787-e1477489782783.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

A VISITING American tourist has heralded the charm of Dublin, particularly the areas which seem to be boarded up, in disrepair and completely neglected, WWN can confirm. 
“I tried one of your pints of the black stuff in the Guinness storehouse and was struck by how you don’t seem to give a shit about the bits of the city I’m not supposed to visit,” Gary Mackey, a Boston native shared when talking to WWN. 
Sticking to the designated ‘tourist zones’ of the city on the first day of his trip, Mr. Mackey was struck by the city’s vibrancy and understated charm but spoke warmly of the lesser spotted parts of the city. 
“I like how you guys just let buildings decay, it’s a great look, so quaint. And don’t get me started on that adorable thing you do, pretending people living in squalor openly on the streets and down lanes just don’t exist,” Mr. Mackey added, full of effusive praise. 
As dictated by the ‘America is better than us’ provision in the constitution, the Irish media are obligated to report en masse when an American is praising Ireland in any shape or form, which has resulted in huge coverage of Mr. Mackey’s thoughts on the unique charm of Dublin city’s degradation and poverty. However, there is no obligation to mention the fact Mr. Mackey has been robbed three times during his visit. 
Tourism Ireland has yet to confirm if they will fine the American for straying outside the designated tourist zones. Each street thought to contain anything unpalatable which approaches conveying the reality of Dublin in 2016 is marked by a no tourist sign which consists of a large X through an image of an overweight American clutching money.

IN A bid to clear up any confusion about their latest ruling on the cremated remains of loved ones, the Vatican confirmed it is still alright to scatter paedophile priests wherever they want, but not ashes. 
Yesterday the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church urged followers not to scatter the ashes of the dead after cremation and instead to store them in places approved by the Church. 
“We’ll make all the decisions on who and what goes where, thank you very much,” German cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller, the prefect of the doctrinal watchdog, told WWN, “Scattering the remains of loved ones on unholy ground will only ruin their chances of staying in heaven. But the scattering of peadophile priests is fine, though; when we’re doing it,” before adding, “Please leave all the important decisions on the welfare of others to us. We won’t let any of our worshipers down”. 
The latest move comes just 53 years after the Vatican ‘legalised’ cremation, mirroring the amount of time it takes for the church to act on various different subjects, including child sex abuse. 
“We don’t make decisions lightly here, so we like to take our time,” the Cardinal admitted, “But when we do, we like to make sure that they are the best decisions tailored for the financial gain of our multi-billion euro a year organisation”. 
A two-page instruction issuing new rules on cremation also said that there were even some cases where a Christian funeral could be denied to those who request that ashes be scattered. 
“There is absolutely no profit for us if someone gets cremated and spread over some field for free,” Muller pointed out, breathing on a 24 carrot ring on his hand before polishing it on his silk gown, “We offer an array of allotments across the world, and at a bargain price too. We’ll even throw in an annual mass and a few prayers graveside for any cremated relative wishing to be buried on sacred ground”. 
Allotments can range anywhere between €5,000 to €19,000 for a family plot, with the church charging over €20,000 for extra holy burial slots.",english,2016-10-26T22:37:32.619+03:00,waterfordwhispersnews.com,US,58305,‘Scattering Of Paedophile Priests Fine Though’ – Vatican,0,http://waterfordwhispersnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/shutterstock_162800975.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

“YOU just have to show that you’re willing to go that extra mile,” said Keith Gernon, angling the webcam on his laptop to give a perfect shot of his bed, where his girlfriend Cathy Wilson is already waiting. 
“We haven’t left the house without a cash deposit with us for the past four months, just so we can grab any property that comes available to rent. But we’re always beaten to it… so we’ve decided to try something new”. 
Gernon and Wilson, both 27, are speaking exclusively to WWN about their difficulties in securing a one bedroom flat in Dublin city centre, and have decided to offer potential landlords a daily sex video broadcast live over a webcam in a bid to give them the ‘edge’ over other renters. 
“The minute a flat goes up on Daft, we mail the landlord and put on a bit of a show for them, letting them know there’s more where that came from,” said Wilson, undressing quickly in a bid to secure a bedsit above a butcher’s shop which just got listed at €1,800 a month.

A man posing as a construction worker destroyed Donald Trump’s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a pickaxe and a sledgehammer early Wednesday morning, as bystanders stopped and watched.
The vandalism was captured on video shortly before 6 a.m. The star, Trump’s name, and the camera icon sitting in the center were all destroyed. The cost of the damage is estimated to be around $2,500. 
The vandal identified himself as “Jamie Otis,” to Deadline Hollywood, and explained that he was planning to “extract the star to auction it off and raise funds” for the women who have accused Trump of being sexually inappropriate. He chatted casually with a person who filmed the incident on his cellphone. 
By the time that police arrived, the man had already left. He is described as a white male, and left behind the pick, sledgehammer, a construction hat, and vest, USA Today reports. 
“We’re reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses and when the case is completed, it will be submitted to the district attorney for filing of a felony vandalism charge,” Officer Norma Eisenman told USA Today. 
The star was dedicated in 2007, and sat at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. by the Dolby Theatre — across the street from the busy Hollywood & Highland shopping and entertainment center. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has said in a statement that Trump’s star will be replaced immediately, and work has already began on it — though it will have to sit for a couple of days before it can be polished. 
“When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California state landmark,” Hollywood Chamber of Commerce president and CEO Leron Gubler said. “Our democracy is based on respect for the law. People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property.” 
Gubler added that they intend to prosecute the vandal to the fullest extent of the law when he is located. 
The star has been a target of vandalism throughout the election season, by people repeatedly spray painting it — and even defecating on it. 
In February, the star was defaced with a large black swastika.

In the fourth undercover video from the guerilla journalists at James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas, Democratic operative Robert Creamer claims to be on daily calls with the Clinton campaign — and accepts a foreign donation.
In the newly released footage, Creamer admits to working directly for the Clinton campaign — overseeing Donald Trump events. 
“I mean frankly I spend most of my time overseeing the Trump event rallies, I mean that’s what I do for the Clinton campaign,” Creamer states. 
In previous video releases from Veritas, Democratic operatives reveal how they had been working to incite violence at Trump rallies, using a tactic called “bird-dogging.” An operative also reveals to the undercover journalists their step-by-step voter fraud strategy. 
The Clinton campaign originally denied working with Creamer and his firm, Democracy Partners. O’Keefe then released a video of Creamer stating that their “Donald Ducks” effort was at the request of the candidate herself. 
“Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters … I am in this campaign mainly to deal with what earned media with television, radio, with earned media and social media, not with paid media, not with advertising,” Creamer says in the latest video. 
He also admits to working directly with Barack Obama, statements that are backed up by his 340 logged visits to the White House — where he met with Obama 45 times. 
“I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issue campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the… the health care bill, for trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.” 
To gain access and trust, O’Keefe reveals that he had provided a $20,000 donation to the Americans for United for Change super PAC from Belize. 
“The more money that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get,” Project Veritas said in their release .
Following the release of the first Veritas videos last week, the PAC suddenly returned the donation — stating that they were concerned it may have been illegal. 
“In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars,” Project Veritas explained. “ He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money.” 
O’Keefe has filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission against both Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee based upon the shocking revelations that his team has uncovered. 
During a rally in Gettysburg on Saturday, Trump promised that he would also be suing the DNC for inciting violence at his rallies, based on what he saw in the Project Veritas videos.

In one of the recordings, from 1991, Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, is heard advising Flowers to deny any claims that he had aided her in getting a state job.
“If they ever asked if you’d talked to me about it, you can say no,” he says.
 
Related Stories Bill Clinton Leads Crowd In Litany Of Obamacare’s Failures Wikileaks: Bill Clinton Accepted ‘Expensive Gifts’ From CGI Donors Activist Who Documented DNC’s ‘Dirty Tricks’ Operation Joining Trump At Debate The recording was released Wednesday on Breitbart .

At the time of the recording, the media had been asking many questions about Clinton’s affair with Flowers and she was worried that the barrage of questions could inevitably lead to inquires into how she landed her job as an administrative assistant for the Arkansas Appeal Tribunal.
 
A complaint was being filed by an anonymous woman who felt that Flowers’ relationship with Clinton kept her from getting the job when, the woman claimed, she was more qualified.
In the audio, Clinton is heard coaching Flowers on how best to deal with the woman and subsequent questions that may arise.
The sections of the audio recordings dealing with the state job were given to the news media in 1992. This came just one day after Clinton had appeared on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary — the current Democratic presidential nominee — blatantly denying any romantic relationship with Flowers.
However, in his deposition for a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, Clinton would eventually admit to having a sexual interaction with Flowers in 1998.

But it wasn’t until now that she turned over the full original recordings to a Breitbart reporter.
The timing of the leak comes at a time when — amid recent sexual harassment allegations against Republican nominee Donald Trump — Clinton has had a number of people questioning his treatment of women.

And now America is taking its stand.
A new Gallup poll shows that respect for the police has hit its highest point in almost 50 years.
 
Related Stories Video: Suspect Beats Female Officer Who Didn’t Use Weapon Out Of Fear Of Backlash Police Officer Issues A Moving Response To Kaepernick’s Protest NBA Anthem Singer Drops To Knee During Final Line To Protest Racial Inequality The poll, taken in early October, found that 76 percent of Americans have “a great deal” of respect for police and another 17 percent say they have “some” respect.
“Obviously, this violent rhetoric we have seen from BLM has backfired ,” wrote Andrew Mark Miller on Young Conservatives.
“People respect the cops more than ever and they clearly see what a difficult job they have,” he added.
 
Miller said the Black Lives Matter movement denies its true purpose.
“And don’t give me this nonsense about how BLM isn’t anti-police,” he wrote. “In fact, many BLM supporters have been out there saying we should eliminate the police force entirely .”
Miller said the bottom line is clear.
“This poll is a repudiation of the tactics the left has used to demonize law enforcement. No getting around it,” he wrote.
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio The level of Americans supporting the police that was reflected in the 2016 poll had not been reached since 1967, when urban riots and protest-driven long, hot summers were making cities dangerous and 77 percent of respondents said they gave police “a great deal” of respect. Gallup began surveying Americans about the police in 1965.
The 2016 poll also shows a major change in attitudes from just a year earlier. The 2015 poll showed the highest level to date of Americans lacking confidence in their police officers, at 18 percent.
“The increase in shootings of police coincided with high-profile incidents of law enforcement officials shooting and killing unarmed black men. Despite the flaring of racial tensions after these incidents, respect for local police has increased among both whites and nonwhites,” Gallup reported in analyzing its results.
“The sharp increase over the past year in professed respect for local law enforcement comes as many police say they feel they are on the defensive — both politically and for their lives while they are on duty — amid heated national discussions on police brutality and shootings,” it added.
Gallup said future events could change the level of support enjoyed by police.
“It’s unclear whether the spike in respect for police will have staying power or if it reflects mostly a reaction to the retaliatory killings against police officers last summer,” it wrote.

On Wednesday’s show, Mika Brzezinski noted that Emanuel, a former adviser to President Barack Obama is “often called one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act.”
“How’s that working for you right now, Zeke?” chimed in host Joe Scarborough.

“Be honest, though,” Scarborough continued. “Zeke only worked on the part of the Affordable Care Act that’s causing increases 25 percent on average.”
Emanuel was once again all smiles.
 
A day before, there were not many smiles when Emanual appeared on CNN and told Jake Tapper the extent of Obamacare’s fiscal effects.
“There’s a million people for whom this is going to be severe or uncomfortable,” he said.
Earlier this week, the Obama administration announced that the average premium costs will rise 25 percent next year. However, some states were far higher. A popular “ silver” healthcare plan is scheduled to increase 116 percent in Arizona; 40 percent in North Carolina; and 53 percent in Pennsylvania.
Emanuel said the problem of rising premiums some Americans will have trouble affording is just part of the way Obamacare evolved.

That doesn’t mean it’s fatal,” he said.
“These price increases that we’re seeing this year are a one-time increase relative to the fact that insurance companies didn’t know who was going to come in, under-priced their premiums in the first few years, and are readjusting them based on who’s in the marketplace,” said Emanuel, suggesting that tweaking the system will fix the problem.
” … it’s what any company would do if they launch a product, some problems arise, and you try to fix them,” he said.

A CBS News report from McAllen, Texas , noted that large numbers of illegal immigrants have crossed the border from Mexico and turned themselves in. They are released by the Border Patrol after being given ankle monitors while they file paperwork to be granted asylum so they can remain in the U.S.
Border Patrol Agent Chris Cabrera said the rush is triggered by politics.

“They’re also being told that if [Republican nominee Donald] Trump gets elected, there’s going to be some magical wall that pops up overnight and once that wall gets up, nobody will ever get in again,” he said.
Cabrera said that on some recent days, agents have netted up to 1,000 immigrants around McAllen.
 
“We’re getting mass spikes of people crossing and turning themselves in,” he said.
For the federal fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, arrests of illegal immigrants crossing to the U.S. along the southern border increased 23 percent , totaling 408,870 people.
Earlier this month, Trump formally accepted the endorsement of the National Border Patrol Council at Trump Tower in New York.
Art Del Cueto, an official with the union who attended the event, said the Obama administration is conscious of the looming election and pushing to have detainees released.

Although some have criminal records, Del Cueto said, “they’re setting them aside because at this point they’re saying immigration is so tied up with trying to get to the people that are on the waiting list, hurry up and get them their immigration status corrected, make them citizens.”
“Why?” asked Trump.
“So they can go ahead and vote before the election,” said Del Cueto.
Trump repeated the claim. “They’re letting people pour into the country so they can go and vote,” he said.
Del Cueto agreed.
“Want to hurry up and fast-track them so they can hurry up and be able to vote for these elections,” hebor said.

“By the way, if I said that, they’d say, ‘He’s violent. How could he have done that?'” Trump said.
Trump, who according to one recent poll has a narrow lead in Florida, told supporters that he was confident of victory .
“In 14 days we are going to win the state of Florida and we are going to win back the White House,” he declared.
“We have a thing going on that they have never seen before. It is a movement. They have never seen anything like it before. We are going to win and we are going to bring back a lot of good things including common sense to the White House,” Trump added.
“We have the power in our hands,” he said. “In just 14 days – 14 days? Can you believe this? I started, it was a year and a half. Now we’re down to 14 days.”
“We had unbelievably tough, nasty primaries. We’re proud to say they were the most difficult and toughest primaries they say in the history of politics. And now we have a nasty, nasty election. But we have the facts on our side,” he added.

Hotel: 'The Future Lies With The Dreamers',"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday celebrated the reuse of a landmark that was heading toward being just another old building before he made it a luxury hotel and turned it into a symbol of what he wants to achieve as president.
Coming off of campaign events in Florida Tuesday and before he jetted off to North Carolina to resume his quest for the White House, Trump was joined by his wife and children at the formal grand opening of the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., built in the city’s historic Old Post Office building.
“Under budget and ahead of schedule. So important. We don’t hear those words so often, but you will,” said Trump , linking the hotel redevelopment to his promised performance as president. “Today is a metaphor for what we can accomplish for this country.”
 
Related Stories Trump Sets GOP Fundraising Milestone In Small-Donor Contributions Newt Gingrich Defends Donald Trump Against ‘Sexual Predator’ Accusations Donald Trump’s Star On Hollywood Walk Of Fame Vandalized Trump also spoke as a developer, not just as a candidate.
“My job is to look at undeveloped spaces and imagine what they could be,” he said. “These are spaces that have no hope, no future. But you need imagination and you need the ability to get them done and to unlock their potential, and to unlock the potential of the people working on those spaces and on those projects, and we have so many things we can do for our country.”
“The United States is great,” he said. “It’s great. Its people are great. There is no task or project too great. There is no dream outside of our reach. Don’t ever let anyone tell you it can’t be done. The future lies with the dreamers, not the cynics and the critics.”
 
The fact that Trump took a few hours for something other than the campaign grated on some who felt the event was an improper distraction.

Republican strategist Steve Schmidt , who helped Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in his 2008 White House race, was among those who said Trump’s priorities were skewed.
“The walls are collapsing,” Schmidt said, referring to polls showing Trump behind. Trump has discounted those polls as inaccurate and pointed to others that show him leading.

You don’t take a time-out to tend to your business interests,” he said.
Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway suggested that a dose of perspective might be useful.
“He’s making a pit stop here in Washington and his under-budget, ahead-of-schedule hotel is really remarkable. It shows Americans the tangible accomplishments of Donald Trump. He’s somebody who builds things. He’s somebody who fixes things,” she said Wednesday on NBC’s Today show.
“And you know, respectfully, Hillary Clinton has time to go to an Adele concert and everybody thinks that’s really cool. Donald Trump stops off to unveil just an incredible, stunning piece of architecture, new hotel, first-class hotel, and everybody’s hair is on fire,” she said.
Conway dared anyone to find a candidate with a more active schedule than Trump.
“Hillary Clinton took five days off to prepare for one debate and everybody looked at that as some kind of noble exercise with 23 days to go. Nobody covered that as, where is she? Why doesn’t she campaign much? What is she doing? Where is she hiding?” Conway said. “He’s got the most active campaign schedule of the two candidates by far.”

He has amassed the largest small-donor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the Republican Party.
Zac Moffatt, an online fundraising expert, said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate.
 
Related Stories Newt Gingrich Defends Donald Trump Against ‘Sexual Predator’ Accusations Donald Trump’s Star On Hollywood Walk Of Fame Vandalized Independent Voters Push Trump To The Front In Florida And Ohio “The people who donate are your core believers,” said Moffatt, who was digital director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign.
Romney and Sen. John McCain, the 2008 GOP nominee, each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than Trump has in total contributions.
However, Trump’s campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions, defined as $200 or less.
 
In this category, Trump has raised more than $78.6 million thus far, based on data from the Federal Election Commission.
In comparison, McCain raised $65.5 million and Romney raised $44.8 million by this point in their election races.
While McCain and Romney had significant income contributions from other sources, Trump’s small-donor income makes up 58 percent of his overall funds.
According to OpenSecrets.org, small donations are a key category because for those below $200 mark the campaigns aren’t legally required to register personal information on the donor, whereas if the donation exceeds $200 the campaign must give the donor’s name, occupation, employer and ZIP code.

As of Oct. 19, the Trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the party’s get-out-the-vote effort, electing instead to have Trump focus on getting across his final message to voters.
“We’ve kind of wound down,” said Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s national finance chairman. “But the online fundraising continues to be strong.”
“We have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political [events],” Mnuchin continued. “Unlike [Democratic nominee] Hillary [Clinton], who has been fundraising and not out and about, he has constantly been out and about.”
This decision has been questioned by some given that Clinton’s campaign has raised $445.4 million, according to OpenSecrets, which is $226.6 million more than the $218.8 million Trump has raised.
Clinton has 41 events lined up before Nov. 4.

Professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts. Brock wants his unregistered solicitor, the Bonner Group, to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason.
David Brock is laundering money 
 
Related Stories Consumers Need Protection From New Consumer Protection Bureau Rule Here’s What The Markets Are Telling Us… Exposed: Profiteers Of Governing – And These Are The Ones Who Got Caught! Brock has seven nonprofits, three super PACs, one 527 committee, one LLC, one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in Washington .
Uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations.
The Bonner Group, his professional solicitor, works off a commission. Every time money gets passed around, Bonner receives a 12.5 percent cut.
 
Follow the money 
Nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants.
But they aren’t required to disclose who gives them cash grants.
This weak system of one-way verification is being abused by Brock. He’s been cycling money between his organizations for years, and the Bonner Group’s 12.5 percent commission gets triggered after every pass.
 
Trending Stories Frustrated With Media Bias, Trump Campaign Takes Its Case Directly To Voters With Nightly Show On Facebook RNC Official Takes CNN Host To Task For Claiming There Is No Media Bias Hannity Proposes A Sendoff For Obama In The Event Of A Trump Presidency In 2014, Media Matters for America raised more than $10 million.
The Bonner Group was credited for raising these funds. Media Matters paid it a $1.1 million commission.

That same year, Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock’s Franklin Education Forum , an organization that shares office space with Media Matters.

In 2014, the Franklin Education Forum reported $994,000 in total contributions, and 93.6 percent of that total came from Media Matters.
Surprisingly, though, the Franklin Education Forum gave full credit to Bonner for raising that money. It paid the fundraiser a $124,250 commission in 2014.

Notice what happened? 
Brock’s Media Matters gave a $930,000 cash grant to Brock’s Franklin Education Forum. Brock’s Franklin Education Forum credited the Bonner Group for raising those funds, triggering the 12.5 percent commission. Brock paid the Bonner Group a $124,250 commission to solicit a cash grant … from himself! It doesn’t stop there 
After the Franklin Education Forum retained $869,750, it sent a $816,224 cash grant to Brock’s Franklin Forum . 

Note: The Franklin Education Forum is a 501(c)3, and The Franklin Forum is a 501(c)4. They are not the same company. 
The Franklin Forum 501(c)4 paid Bonner a commission in 2013 , so it’s safe to assume the fundraiser received a $102,028 commission in 2014. Unfortunately, it’s hard to tell for sure. It still hasn’t filed its taxes for 2014!
Let’s recap 
Say, for example, you donate $1,062,857 to Media Matters for America. This is how David Brock would have used your charitable donation in 2014:
Media Matters would receive your $1,062,857 donation. The Bonner Group would earn a $132,857 commission. Media Matters would retain $930,000. Next, Media Matters would give what’s left of your entire donation , $930,000, to the Franklin Education Forum. The Bonner Group would “earn” a $116,250 commission. The Franklin Education Forum would retain $813,750. The Franklin Education Forum would then forward the remaining $813,750 to The Franklin Forum. The Bonner Group would “earn” a $101,718 commission. The Franklin Forum would retain $712,031. In the end, Brock’s solicitor would have pocketed $350,825, almost a third of your initial donation. That’s a far cry from the advertised 12.5 percent commission.
As bizarre as that scenario may sound, this is exactly what Brock did in 2014.
How can we be sure this is intentional? 
Brock is the chairman for each of these organizations. How could he not know what’s going on?
He’s a hands-on chairman. According to their tax returns, Brock allocates time, weekly, to his organizations:
Media Matters: 31.50 hours per week Franklin Education Forum: three hours per week The Franklin Forum: one hour per week Furthermore, The New York Times reports that Brock shares a summer rental in the Hamptons with Mary Pat Bonner, the president of the Bonner Group.
Brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this. These transfers are intentional. He vacations with his solicitor. Case closed.
Still not convinced? 
Brock didn’t even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers. They all share the same number.

What if …? 
We even located the Bonner Group’s solicitation agreement with Media Matters on Florida’s Gift Givers’ Guide . Clarification on the commission can be found on page 2:

In English: Contractually, Brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission. In spite of this option, he intentionally chooses to trigger the 12.5 percent commission for money grants between his organizations.
Note: Yes, we are making the assumption that all of Brock’s organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the Bonner Group. Given that his organizations share the same address, board members and telephone number, we feel it’s safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement. 
This barely scratches the surface 
Utilizing public-facing tax returns, along with records submitted to the Federal Election Commission, we mapped out all the significant money transfers from 2014 that took place in Brock’s office:

Summary 
This is all from just one year! No further commentary required.
We understand this may be hard to believe. We first came across this in July, and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it.
All of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources. Check for yourself — we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in Brock’s office. These data have been sitting out in the open, gathering dust for years. 
If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.
We’ve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity. But there aren’t any loopholes. David Brock has something to hide. Just last month, The Daily Caller reported the following:
“Brock’s former long-time live-in boyfriend William Grey (whom Brock has thanked in several of his books) threatened to go to the IRS with damaging information about how Brock was running his Media Matters empire. What did Brock do? He paid Grey $850,000 to keep quiet. Brock reportedly had to sell his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, to come up with the money. This certainly seems to indicate that Brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover.”
Adding to this, Fox News reported the following:
“Grey accused Brock of ‘financial malfeasance’ and threatened to undermine Brock’s fundraising efforts.
“‘Next step is I contact all your donors and the IRS,’ Grey wrote in an email dated May 19, 2010. ‘This is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now.'”
We believe that the information presented in this article is what has Brock so terrified. We feel confident in saying, with close to absolute certainty, that David Brock is laundering money through his Media Matters conglomerate.

Her kidnapping quickly garnered national media attention. Her media savvy parents worked overtime to keep her story in the news throughout the ordeal.
During her 9 months in captivity she was raped repeatedly, often as many as 3-4 times per day. Each day was a mental and physical war for her to survive at the hands of her kidnapper and rapist, Brian David Mitchell.

Justice wasn’t finally served until 2011 when Mitchell received two life-terms in a federal prison.

Now as a parent herself, Smart has realized how horrible the kidnapping was for her parents.
“When I go back to my own situation, I almost think it was worse for my parents than for me because I knew that I was alive, but they didn’t know,” she told People magazine.
“I always knew how much they loved me, but until I had my own daughter I didn’t realize how all-consuming that is. The worst thing in the world would be if something happened to my little girl,” she continued.
Smart has made it her life’s work as a reporter, teacher and activist to make sure other parents, families, victims and survivors are supported, “Nobody should have to go through the aftermath of a terrible crime alone.”

“What the president said was an entirely factual response,” Earnest said to a group of reporters in Los Angeles where Obama was attending Democratic fundraisers.
Earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the president’s actions as mere conspiracies.
 
Related Stories Hannity Proposes A Sendoff For Obama In The Event Of A Trump Presidency WikiLeaks: Podesta Said Obamas ‘Don’t Need To Be This Nice’ To President Bush And First Lady WikiLeaks Reveals Obama Knew About Clinton’s Emails; ‘Clean This Up’ “I recognize that some of the president’s critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state,” he said.
He continued, “But they’ve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny, so I guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies.”
Obama himself denied any knowledge of the server, telling CBS reporter Bill Plante in March 2015, just after the server revelations that he learned of the Clinton’s private email server “the same time everybody else learned it through news reports.”
 
Several days after the server revelations in March 2015, Earnest told the press that Obama knew about Clinton’s email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server.
He reiterated that position on Tuesday.
“The president did trade emails with Secretary Clinton, not a large number of them,” Earnest said.
“Of course the president had possession of Secretary Clinton’s email address, but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email.”

“[L]ooks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news,” Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said in a March 7, 2015 email published Tuesday by WikiLeaks.
“[W]e need to clean this up – he has emails from her – they do not say state.gov,” responded former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills.

He is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially. Print Dr. Eric Walsh (Photo: First Liberty) 
The state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
But Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
The state’s demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
He’s getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
Walsh’s ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
Lee Rudd, the agency’s human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. 
At that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin & Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
“Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today! 
Now, in response to Walsh’s lawsuit, the state delivered a “Request for Production of Documents” that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, “copies of his sermon notes and transcripts.” 
“This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church,” said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. 
“No government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons,” said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. “I cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.” 
Officials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
Walsh’s lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
On the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
WND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parker’s actions as possibly “one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen.” 
The mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
In a prepared statement Wednesday on Walsh’s case, Welch said, “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Georgia’s demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from … us.” 
Welch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is “worse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons.” 
“First, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,” he said. “Also, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor’s preaching Bible. It’s almost as if they are ransacking the pastor’s study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America.” 
Leaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nation’s largest public policy women’s group with 500,000 members, also came to Walsh’s defense. 
Penny Nance, CEO, said: “The words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,’ still reverberate today – especially as we witness the ‘Gestapo-like’ tactics of his native state. The state of Georgia’s blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. 
“Can there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share?” 
WND reported earlier on the case brought against the state after its officials reviewed Walsh’s sermons and then fired him. 
“No one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon,” Dys told Fox News when the case was filed. “He was fired for something he said in a sermon. If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything.” The original state investigation of Walsh’s sermons apparently was sparked by “one complaint” from an official with a county Democratic Party and “gay activist.” 
State officials also joked about informing Walsh of his firing. 
The telephone call was between Dr. Patrick O’Neal, an agency official, and Kate Pfirman, an agency financial officer. The call was captured on an answering machine, which also caught their conversation after they thought they had hung up. 
Pfirman said: “And I’m gonna be very – I’m gonna try to come off as very cold, because I don’t want to say very much. If I try to make it warm – I’ve thought that through, it’s gonna just not – there’s no warm way to say it anyway.” 
Then there was laughter from both parties. 
O’Neal then said to inform Walsh, “You’re out,” and there was another round of laughter. 
“It’s very funny,” Pfirman said.

The state of Georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the Department of Public Health after it investigated what he said in his church. 
But Dr. Eric Walsh is resisting, issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers. 
The state’s demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by Walsh against the Department of Health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations. 
He’s getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by Houston officials for copies of his sermons. 
Walsh’s ordeal began in May 2014 when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency. Only a week later, a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a Seventh-day Adventist Church. 
Lee Rudd, the agency’s human resources director, then assigned staff members to listen to the YouTube recordings immediately. Two days later, Walsh was fired. 
At that point, lawyers with First Liberty Institute joined forces with the Atlanta legal team of Parks, Chesin & Walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency. 
“Police State USA: How Orwell’s Nightmare Is Becoming Our Reality” chronicles how America has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state, and what led to an out-of-control government that increasingly ignores the Constitution. Order today! 
Now, in response to Walsh’s lawsuit, the state delivered a “Request for Production of Documents” that demands, among a flood of other paperwork, “copies of his sermon notes and transcripts.” 
“This is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church,” said Jeremy Dys, senior counsel for First Liberty. 
“No government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons,” said Walsh in a statement released by his lawyers. “I cannot and will not give up my sermons unless I am forced to do so.” 
Officials with the Georgia Department of Health declined to respond to a WND request for comment, instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general, who did not respond to a request for comment. 
Walsh’s lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support. 
On the guest list was Pastor Dave Welch of Houston, one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code. 
WND broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when Rush Limbaugh described Parker’s actions as possibly “one of the most vile, filthy, blatant violations of the Constitution that I have seen.” 
The mayor at the time, Annise Parker, withdrew the demands amid a flood of protest . 
In a prepared statement Wednesday on Walsh’s case, Welch said, “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but Georgia’s demand is even worse than when the mayor of Houston demanded 17 different categories of materials, including sermons, from … us.” 
Welch, the executive director of the Texas Pastor Council, said what is happening to Walsh is “worse than what happened in Houston for multiple reasons.” 
“First, this is state government coming after a pastor, not just a rogue mayor in one city,” he said. “Also, the state is demanding much more material: sermons, sermon notes, all documents without even topical or time limits. It could even include margin notes in this pastor’s preaching Bible. It’s almost as if they are ransacking the pastor’s study. This sweeping demand is ominous and a threat to every pastor, every church, every denomination, and every citizen of faith in America.” 
Leaders of Concerned Women for America Legislative Action Committee, part of the nation’s largest public policy women’s group with 500,000 members, also came to Walsh’s defense. 
Penny Nance, CEO, said: “The words of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that, ‘Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,’ still reverberate today – especially as we witness the ‘Gestapo-like’ tactics of his native state. The state of Georgia’s blatant attack on religious freedom, as they discriminate against another pastor, Dr. Eric Walsh, is indeed a threat to every American, whatever our religious beliefs. 
“Can there be a clearer violation of our First Amendment right to religious freedom than for the state to monitor, examine, and retaliate against a person because of the sermons they share?”

Jesus Christ of Nazareth is not the Republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
But if He were, Democrats would try to “destroy” Him in the same manner they’re attacking the 2016 GOP candidate, Donald Trump. 
That’s according to radio host Rush Limbaugh, who hypothesized what this year’s race would look like if the Son of God were at the top of the Republican ticket. 
Should President Trump try to prosecute Hillary? Sign the hottest petition in America now to show your support! 
“It doesn’t matter who the Republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment Trump’s getting. It wouldn’t have mattered,” Limbaugh said Wednesday. 
“They would go out of their way to find ways to destroy Jesus Christ if he could be nominated as a Republican. The Democrats would do everything they could, include calling Him a liar, the Bible a fake book, whatever it took.” Rush Limbaugh 
And despite the fact the Bible never indicates Jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, Limbaugh suggested Democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of His offspring: 
“They would scour the historical record looking for children He had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit Jesus. That’s who they are. That’s what they would do.” 
Limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that Republicans would never escape “this kind of media assault based on who we nominate.” Donald Trump’s RNC acceptance speech (Photo: Screenshot from RNC live feed) 
“I say this because a lot of you Never Trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like Trump. No, it’s exactly what you get when you nominate a Republican. Whenever there is any opposition to the Democrats, this is what they do. It doesn’t matter. They’re gonna do it. They did it to Romney … 
“I’ve made this point ’til I blue in the face. They turned Romney, who is mild-mannered Mr. Gosh, Can’t Even Get Noticed into the biggest walking Satan, El Diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick So this is why I think Trump has so many people supporting him. He’s fighting back against it when most Republicans haven’t and don’t.” 
As an example of how media treatment of Republicans has not changed, Limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from CBS. Commentator Bill Moyers characterized the race before it was known that Republican Ronald Reagan would easily defeat Democrat Jimmy Carter. Moyers stated: 
“Those of you who might speak Spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember,” said Carter, “who’s been your friend.” And there under the California sun in San Diego at a shopping center, Ronald Reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which he’s been a master since his days at Eureka College. Suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their ERA signs. Reagan took his cue and snapped back, “Aw, shut up!” 
And thousands of supporters roared their approval. Those are the people for whom Ronald Reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. Jimmy Carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. Reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, “Enough’s enough.” 
“Does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world?” Limbaugh asked. “Not an iota!”

A Hillary Clinton-supporting advocacy organization had no trouble accepting a $20,000 donation funneled through a Belize bank to use in this year’s presidential election campaign – until its decision was about to be made public in a series of undercover videos by James O’Keefe’s Project Veritas Action. 
Suddenly, the head of the organization expressed suspicion about the donation’s overseas origin and decided to return it. 
That’s one of the significant revelations in the latest in a series of videos released by O’Keefe called “Rigging the Election.” 
O’Keefe explained he had a fictitious donor meet with Bob Creamer, who was a staffer at Americans United for Change, a group supporting Clinton for president, until the videos started appearing last week. 
He said Creamer, who boasted of working directly for the Clinton campaign, directed that the $20,000 donation go to AUFC “to disrupt rallies and fund bracketing ops.” 
O’Keefe said he and his colleagues were very careful not to violate the law themselves. 
Creamer was clear about his ties to Clinton, stating, “Every morning I am on a call at 10:30 that goes over the message being driven by the campaign headquarters.” 
Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump’s call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! 
Project Veritas’ first video explained how the Clinton campaign uses “hidden connections” to incite violence at Donald Trump rallies. Its second video showed plans for step-by-step voter fraud and the third exposed “prohibited communications” between Hillary Clinton’s campaign, “the DNC and the nonprofit Americans United for Change.” 
The fourth video “breaks down the process of the long-term investigation.” It comes after Creamer’s announcement that he was stepping down from campaign responsibilities. 
O’Keefe and Project Veritas Action have filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. 
Among the revelations in the latest video was Creamer was boasting of his close links to President Obama. 
“Oh, Barack Obama’s was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good, too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect,” he said. “He’s a pro, I’ve known the president since he was a community organizer in Chicago.” 
When asked whether a potential donor could meet Obama, Creamer said: “OK, you may have a lot more opportunity once he is done in 98 days, 97. I was just at an event with him in Chicago, Friday of last week, he is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the … the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.” 
Explained Project Veritas: “The more that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action’s $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos.” 
In the first video, Foval, a Democratic operative, boasted of what he called “conflict engagement,” or sending protesters to disrupt Trump events. 
“We’re starting anarchy here,” he said. “And he needs to understand that we’re starting anarchy.” 
In the second video, Creamer explained Clinton’s direct control over those disruption operations. 
“In the end it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future President of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground,” Creamer said. 
Creamer, the husband of Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. 
Here’s the third: 
That video also revealed a direct conflict between what Creamer was confirming – Clinton’s active involvement in such decisions and campaigns – and the claim of her campaign manager, Robby Mook. 
Mook told CNN over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and Clinton.

“These individuals no longer have a relationship with the DNC,” he said. “They’ve never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened I think in February of last year. 
“They did not have a contract with the DNC until June. But putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we don’t know what the full context is. And there’s no evidence whatsoever … that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the DNC.” 
His comments: 
After confirming it was Clinton or “wanted ducks on the ground,” Creamer warned undercover Project Veritas journalists, “Don’t repeat that to anybody.” 
Creamer ran Democracy Partners, a consulting company with ties to Clinton. 
He has been to the White House 342 times while Obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with Obama. 
O’Keefe’s organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the DNC and the Americans United for Change “smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures.” 
Last week , Project Veritas filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission asking for an investigation into the Clinton campaign’s “criminal conspiracy.” 
The filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which Democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. 
The video have resulted already in two Democratic operatives losing their jobs. 
Editor’s Note: Be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. 
One is Scott Foval, who had worked for People for the American Way, a George Soros-funded group, and more recently with Americans United for Change. 
In the video, he said: “You know what? We’ve been busing people in to deal with you f—ing a—–es for 50 years, and we’re not going to stop now.” 
Also, he said he and his agents are “starting anarchy” by creating “conflict engagement … in the lines at Trump rallies.” 
Also out of work is Creamer. 
See the second video: 
Talk-radio icon Rush Limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome. 
“Every Trump rally would feature none of this [violence] unless the Democrats were paying for it. I think it’s a big deal, folks. The media is complicit. They know who these people are. … They’re in on it. They’re part of the game. … None of it’s organic. None of it’s natural. None of it’s real. Every bit of it is bought and paid for. 
“[Democrats] can’t leave elections to chance because they know that, despite the way it may look, the majority of Americans would not support them if they knew who they are.”

I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues, helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the … the health care bill, trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.” 
Explained Project Veritas: “The more that was promised to Creamer, the more access Project Veritas Action journalists seemed to get. Project Veritas Action’s $20,000 investment paid off. The story was solid. Robert Creamer, Scott Foval, Jenna Price from the DNC, Brad Woodhouse from AUFC, Cesar Vargas and others opened the door to their smoke filled rooms of illegal and dirty campaign dealings, as seen in the three previous PVA videos.” 
In the first video, Foval, a Democratic operative, boasted of what he called “conflict engagement,” or sending protesters to disrupt Trump events. 
“We’re starting anarchy here,” he said. “And he needs to understand that we’re starting anarchy.” 
In the second video, Creamer explained Clinton’s direct control over those disruption operations. 
“In the end it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future President of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground, so by god we would get ducks on the ground,” Creamer said. 
Creamer, the husband of Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, has starred in several of the undercover videos. 
Here’s the third: 
That video also revealed a direct conflict between what Creamer was confirming – Clinton’s active involvement in such decisions and campaigns – and the claim of her campaign manager, Robby Mook. 
Mook told CNN over the weekend that there was no pathway between the activists staging violence and Clinton. 
Sign the precedent-setting petition supporting Trump’s call for an independent prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton! 
“These individuals no longer have a relationship with the DNC,” he said. “They’ve never had a relationship with the Clinton campaign and my understanding is that the events that are referenced happened I think in February of last year. 
“They did not have a contract with the DNC until June. But putting all that aside, this was again a video that was leaked out with the purpose of damaging the campaign, it is edited so we don’t know what the full context is. And there’s no evidence whatsoever … that anyone ever did anything like this when they were working for the DNC.” 
His comments: 
After confirming it was Clinton or “wanted ducks on the ground,” Creamer warned undercover Project Veritas journalists, “Don’t repeat that to anybody.” 
Creamer ran Democracy Partners, a consulting company with ties to Clinton. 
He has been to the White House 342 times while Obama has been president, including 47 meetings directly with Obama. 
O’Keefe’s organization reported that the coordination between the campaign, the DNC and the Americans United for Change “smacks of illegal coordinated campaign expenditures.” 
Last week , Project Veritas filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission asking for an investigation into the Clinton campaign’s “criminal conspiracy.” 
The filing of the complaint with the federal agency follows the release of two videos in which Democrats explain how they can attempt to change the outcome of the election through apparently fraudulent means, such as having people travel across state lines to vote illegally. 
The video have resulted already in two Democratic operatives losing their jobs. 
Editor’s Note: Be aware of offensive language throughout videos and in quotes from videos. 
One is Scott Foval, who had worked for People for the American Way, a George Soros-funded group, and more recently with Americans United for Change. 
In the video, he said: “You know what? We’ve been busing people in to deal with you f—ing a—–es for 50 years, and we’re not going to stop now.” 
Also, he said he and his agents are “starting anarchy” by creating “conflict engagement … in the lines at Trump rallies.” 
Also out of work is Creamer. 
See the second video: 
Talk-radio icon Rush Limbaugh said the evidence is worrisome. 
“Every Trump rally would feature none of this [violence] unless the Democrats were paying for it. I think it’s a big deal, folks. The media is complicit. They know who these people are. … They’re in on it. They’re part of the game. … None of it’s organic. None of it’s natural. None of it’s real. Every bit of it is bought and paid for. 
“[Democrats] can’t leave elections to chance because they know that, despite the way it may look, the majority of Americans would not support them if they knew who they are.”

Jesus Christ of Nazareth is not the Republican nominee for president in this election cycle. 
But if He were, Democrats would try to “destroy” Him in the same manner they’re attacking the 2016 GOP candidate, Donald Trump. 
That’s according to radio host Rush Limbaugh, who hypothesized what this year’s race would look like if the Son of God were at the top of the Republican ticket. 
Should President Trump try to prosecute Hillary? Sign the hottest petition in America now to show your support! 
“It doesn’t matter who the Republicans would have nominated, they were gonna get the treatment Trump’s getting. It wouldn’t have mattered,” Limbaugh said Wednesday. 
“They would go out of their way to find ways to destroy Jesus Christ if he could be nominated as a Republican. The Democrats would do everything they could, include calling Him a liar, the Bible a fake book, whatever it took.” Rush Limbaugh 
And despite the fact the Bible never indicates Jesus was married or had sex out of wedlock, Limbaugh suggested Democrats would do their best effort in trying to find any of His offspring: 
“They would scour the historical record looking for children He had fathered, anything they could do to disapprove the gospel to discredit Jesus. That’s who they are. That’s what they would do.” 
Limbaugh said the point he was stressing was that Republicans would never escape “this kind of media assault based on who we nominate.” Donald Trump’s RNC acceptance speech (Photo: Screenshot from RNC live feed) 
“I say this because a lot of you Never Trumpers are out there claiming that this is exactly what you get when you nominate a guy like Trump. No, it’s exactly what you get when you nominate a Republican. Whenever there is any opposition to the Democrats, this is what they do. It doesn’t matter. They’re gonna do it. They did it to Romney … 
“I’ve made this point ’til I blue in the face. They turned Romney, who is mild-mannered Mr. Gosh, Can’t Even Get Noticed into the biggest walking Satan, El Diablo politics had ever seen at that time, and they made it stick So this is why I think Trump has so many people supporting him. He’s fighting back against it when most Republicans haven’t and don’t.” 
As an example of how media treatment of Republicans has not changed, Limbaugh played an excerpt of 1980 election-night coverage from CBS. Commentator Bill Moyers characterized the race before it was known that Republican Ronald Reagan would easily defeat Democrat Jimmy Carter. Moyers stated: 
“Those of you who might speak Spanish, who might be black, who might be women, remember,” said Carter, “who’s been your friend.” And there under the California sun in San Diego at a shopping center, Ronald Reagan was delivering himself of one of those patriotic soliloquies at which he’s been a master since his days at Eureka College. Suddenly hecklers in the crowd started shouting and waving their ERA signs. Reagan took his cue and snapped back, “Aw, shut up!” 
And thousands of supporters roared their approval. Those are the people for whom Ronald Reagan is the apostle of the rollback, the knight who promises finally to slay the dragon of liberal government. Jimmy Carter won four years ago as an outsider, and, if he wins at all tonight, it must be as an insider defending the status quo. Reagan has cast himself as a sheriff who comes riding into town at just in the nick of time shouting, “Enough’s enough.” 
“Does it sound like anything has changed in the way these people see the world?” Limbaugh asked. “Not an iota!”

The US- led coalition is preparing an offensive to oust ISIS from its de-facto capital Raqqa in Syria according to the US Defense Secretary. 
Ash Carter said the operation will likely start before the battle for Mosul is won and Russia has not been invited to join the effort. 
In an interview with NBC, Carter said the assault will start in the next few weeks. 
“We have already begun laying the groundwork to commence the isolation in Raqqa,” the Pentagon chief said at a press conference in Paris. 
RT reports: 
According to Carter, the two officials agreed that the 13-state military coalition that gathered in the French capital would proceed with a sense of “urgency and focus” and confirmed previous statements that there will be a likely “overlap” with the assault on Mosul, which began earlier this month. 
Earlier on Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande warned that many of the ISIS fighters in Mosul could simply sneak out among refugees and relocate to Raqqa, unless the coalition cuts them off. 
There were up to 6,000 Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) fighters in the Iraqi city before fighting began, while Raqqa, which Carter described as “the nexus of much of [IS] operational planning,” will be defended by an estimated 3-4,000 recruits. 
Carter stated that the bulk of the assault contingent would be assembled from “capable and motivated local forces that we identify and then enable.” 
“The lasting defeat of [Islamic State] can’t be achieved by outsiders; it can only be achieved by Syrians enabled by us,” said Carter. 
With the battle over Mosul – a city of 1.5 million people before it was conquered by Islamic State in 2014 – expected to last weeks or months, the Pentagon is not committing itself to a tight deadline. 
“I think everything is trending positively, and that we should be able to commence that effort sometime in the near future. And again, I can’t even ballpark ‘near future’ right now but it’s imminent,” said a senior Pentagon official, speaking to Reuters and other media anonymously in Paris. 
Russia has not been invited to join the effort. The US-led coalition has condemned Moscow’s involvement in Syria, which was officially invited by the government of President Bashar Assad. 
“Russia is not a participant in our Raqqa plan,” said Carter, who insisted that despite the breakdown of a proposed US and Russia-mediated ceasefire and accusations over Aleppo the two sides have a shared interest in defeating IS. 
“We do deconflict our coalition operations with Russia through a very professional military-to-military channel. That channel is active every day, and everyone behaves themselves very professionally on both sides in that channel,” Carter added. 
The Kurds, another major faction that has played a key role in combatting Islamist threats in Syria, are expected to stay away from Raqqa, in part because it lies outside the area they view as their unrecognized homeland. 
“Truthfully, the Kurds that I’ve dealt with don’t intend – they’re not comfortable going into Raqqa. They know they can play a role in shaping and isolating Raqqa but it’s not their intent to be involved in the actual seizure of the city,” said the Pentagon source cited by Reuters. 
The Syrian administration has so far not reacted to the plan, though has previously condemned the international force – which has supported the uprising against President Assad since 2011 – for violating the country’s sovereignty. 
The US-led coalition has executed air strikes on Raqqa since 2014, despite having no UN mandate to operate inside Syria. It has not been in position to carry out a full-scale ground assault. 
Despite saying he was “encouraged” by the progress of the campaign against ISIS, both Carter and Hollande warned separately that the group may further evolve its tactics and redirect its efforts towards guerilla insurgency or suicide attacks in Europe.",english,2016-10-26T21:25:36.963+03:00,yournewswire.com,GB,43665,US ‘Laying Groundwork’ For Raqqa Offensive In Syria,0,http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Ash-Carter.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Donald Trump has warned that Hillary Clinton’s policy towards Syria would lead to World War III , arguing that the Democratic nominee would drag the US into a confrontation with nuclear armed Russia. 
Trump said “You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton” adding that “What we should do is focus on ISIS We should not be focusing on Syria” 
The US Republican presidential nominee made the remarks on Tuesday during a Reuters interview in response to Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” in Syria. 
Press TV reports: 
On October 7, the Democratic nominee said a no-fly zone was required inside the war-ravaged country to stabilize fighting, a move that was opposed in Congress due to the risk of entering into conflict with Russia, since a US-enforced no-fly zone would mean the US could shoot down Russian fighter jets should they enter Syrian airspace. 
Clinton also described the situation in Syria as “incredibly complex” since the intervention of Russia. 
“You’re not fighting Syria anymore; you’re fighting Syria, Russia and Iran, all right? Russia is a nuclear country, but a country where the nukes work as opposed to other countries that talk,” Trump said. 
The Republican nominee also referred to the removal of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power as a second-level priority to defeating Daesh. 
“Assad is secondary, to me, to ISIL,” Trump said. 
Russia might down US planes 
Meanwhile, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper also warned about the consequences of Clinton’s push for a no-fly zone in Syria that could spark a conflict with Russia. 
Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clapper said Clinton’s proposal for the establishment of a no-fly zone in Syria could lead to Russia shooting down American planes there. 
“I wouldn’t put it past them to shoot down an American aircraft if they — if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground,” he said. 
“I take stock in the nature of the weaponry that they deploy and why they — why they did that,” Clapper said of Russian weapons recently deployed to Syria. “The system they have there is a very advanced air-defense system. It’s very capable. And I don’t think they’d do it and deploy it unless they had some intent to use it.” 
During the third and final presidential debate last week, Clinton reiterated her remarks on a no-fly zone that could save lives and hasten the end of the conflict in Syria. 
A foreign-backed militancy has been going on in Syria since March 2011, with a plethora of armed groups — each supported by one foreign country or another — fighting the Assad government. 
Since 2014, the United States, along with a number of its allies, has been leading a so-called anti-terror campaign in Syria and neighboring Iraq.

Spain is having to review its decision to allow Russian warships to refuel at one of its ports amid international outrage. 
“The latest stopover requests are being reviewed at the moment based on the information we are receiving from our allies and from Russian authorities,” the Spanish foreign ministry said. 
A naval fleet headed by the Admiral Kuznetzov aircraft carrier, which passed through the English Channel last week, was expected to dock this morning in the autonomous enclave of Ceuta to take on fuel and supplies under a permit issued by Spain’s Foreign Ministry. 
NATO, the British government & EU officials have expressed anger even though Spain says Russia’s warships have been mooring there “for years.” 
The Independent reports: 
Asked about Spain’s role in supplying the fleet, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato Secretary-General, said he was “concerned”. 
“I have expressed that very clearly about potential use of this battle group to increase Russia’s ability and to be a platform for airstrikes against Syria,” he added. 
“I repeat those concerns today and I believe that all Nato allies are aware that this battle group can be used to conduct airstrikes against Aleppo and Syria.” 
Guy Verhofstadt, president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament, called Spain’s decision “scandalous”. 
He wrote on Twitter: “Spain signed EU statement on Russian war crimes in Aleppo last week – today [Tuesday] helps refuel fleet on way to commit more atrocities. Seriously?” 
The UK said that although access to Spanish ports was a matter for local authorities, concerns had been raised. 
“Her Majesty’s government has previously expressed concerns to the Spanish government about its hospitality to the Russian navy when we have concerns about Russia’s military activity,” a British Government spokesperson said. 
Spain, a Nato member, regularly allows Russian war ships to stop in its enclave of Ceuta, which borders Morocco at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea. 
A spokesperson for the foreign ministry told El Pais permission was granted on a case-by-case basis depending on the ship in question and possibly security risks. 
“We are looking at the latest [supply] stops requested based on information requested by Russian authorities,” he added.

A French politician says the dismantling of the camp will have no effect on the thousands of refugees who seek to cross the channel to England for its generous welfare system. 
RT.com reports: 
Philippe Mignonet, the deputy mayor of Calais, believes the demolition of the ‘Jungle’ refugee camp will not stop the thousands of migrants from congregating in the French port town in the hope of crossing the English Channel. 
“ The UK government says it does not want any more migrants but it never expels migrants who get there, ” Mignonet told the Daily Mail . 
“ They claim benefits and housing, and all we get is the British-funded wall and fences. ” 
For Mignonet, the £2 million (US$2.4 million) British-funded wall being built around the loading area of the Eurotunnel, which allows goods trucks to come from France into Britain, is simply not enough. 
“ What English city would accept a fence and a wall being built by another country on their land? If the British government want to improve matters, they should come and talk to the city of Calais, ” he added. 
Mignonet invited Prime Minister Theresa May to visit the town, and even offered to give her a covert ride from the airport. 
“ I have a car with dark windows, so she doesn’t have to be seen, ” Mignonet said. 
“ Calais was once part of England, and we have often worked together in the past. We can work together again. The people of Britain made their choice about Brexit, and some of those choices mean they will face difficulty, but putting walls and fences up here is not right. ” 
The wall, which is seen as a blight on the coastal town, could also affect the price of the land once occupied by the Jungle camp, which will soon be ready for private development. 
“ This is at the door of England, and near to the shuttle terminal for trucks, ” Mignonet said. “ What better place for British businesses to come? ” 
Tighter border 
The British public appears unmoved by French concerns. A new poll suggests most Brits would rather see their borders tightly secured than stay in the single market. 
According to a poll commissioned by ITV, 58 percent of Brits approve of May’s Brexit strategy of prioritizing immigration controls over the negotiation of the UK’s access to the single market. Only a quarter were against. 
Just over 40 percent of those asked insisted EU trade benefits should be prioritized throughout the divorce. However, a similar Sky News poll found the opposite to be the case. 
A breakdown of the data, however, showed twice as many older Brits support May’s ‘hard Brexit’ and immigration control policies as the younger demographic.",english,2016-10-26T22:03:35.163+03:00,yournewswire.com,GB,43665,French Politician Blames UK Welfare System For Calais Jungle Crisis,0,http://cdns.yournewswire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CWy1Dn8WEAA7PnU.jpg-large.jpg,0,1,0,0,0,bs

It comes just days after Russian ships sailed through the English Channel testing British defences on their way to the Mediterranean for possible offensive operations in Syria. 
International tensions are mounting as communications between America and Russia over their operations in Syria break down. 
The Daily Express report: 
British soldiers will travel to Estonia in what is one of the biggest build-ups of foreign firepower on Russia’s border since the Cold War. 
The move will take place next spring, with Denmark and France also taking part in the huge military exercise. 
The project was revealed by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, who said the UK’s forces will be “fully combat-capable”. 
He said: “That battalion will be defensive in nature, but it will be fully combat-capable. 
“This is about two things: reassurance, and that needs to be done with some formidable presence, and deterrence. 
“This is not simply a trip-wire. This is a serious military presence.” 
Cold War-style tensions between Moscow and Washington took a further dip this week after the US revealed plans to station marines in Norway – just a few hundred miles from the border with Russia. 
Officials in Norway and the US said they were considering a deal for extra equipment and training for the Scandinavian country. 
Russia has reacted angrily to the plans, saying there was “the absence of threat from Russia to Norway”. 
Mr Putin made a similar show of force last month, when he orchestrated a military evacuation drill including a staggering 40 million people. 
The huge four-day “civil defence” drill set alarm bells ringing in Washington and London, with tensions already high over disagreements in Syria. 
Russia’s Ministry for Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Consequences of Natural Disaster revealed 40 million civilians, 200,000 emergency rescuers and 50,000 units of equipment were involved in the war game, which ran from October 4 to October 7. 
And last month two RAF jets were scrambled to intercept Russian bombers which had flown threateningly close to British airspace. 
While the two Russian Blackjack bombers did not enter British airspace, authorities were alarmed when they passed to the west of the Shetland Islands. 
The Ministry of Defence revealed jets from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Coningsby were eventually launched as a “precautionary measure”. 
The Russian planes, which had travelled from the direction of Norway, then continued their route away from Britain. 
A similar incident occurred again last, when the RAF were twice forced to scramble jets to intercept Russian bombers. 
Putin’s aircrafts flew in an “area of interest” off the coast of Scotland on October 12 and October 16, the MoD revealed. This latest development comes amid a massive break-down in communication between America and Russia over their operations in Syria. 
A spokesman for the US State Department said earlier this month: “Extremist groups will continue to exploit the vacuums that are there in Syria to expand their operations.

Two powerful earthquakes struck central Italy on Wednesday, causing fear among residents still rattled by a deadly tremor in August. 
An 6.0-magnitude earthquake hit the Marche region almost two hours after a 5.4-magnitude quake damaged buildings and cut power lines across the area. 
There have been no reports of casualties so far. 
RT reports: 
The latest earthquake occurred 71 km east of Perugia, with United States Geological Survey reporting it as a 6.0-magnitude temblor, and Italy’s National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology saying it was 5.9-magnitude.

— EMSC (@LastQuake) October 26, 2016 
The first earthquake was detected at 7:11pm local time, about 66km to the southeast of Perugia, striking a mountainous part of the Marche region and lasting several seconds.The exact epicenter of the tremblor remains unclear, but it was relatively shallow, at about 9km below ground. 
Within an hour of the first earthquake, there was a series of small but noticeable aftershocks, ranging in magnitude from 2.5 to 2.8. 
“We’re in the square, all the lights are out, we can’t see, we’re counting each other to see who’s here, we still don’t know how bad the situation is,” Mauro Falcucci, mayor of Castelsantangelo sul Nera, the small commune closest to the epicenter, told Sky News by phone. “The situation is delicate. It is important to remain calm.” 
The official said that the emergency is exacerbated by a downpour, and intermittent problems with mobile phone communication.

Just yesterday we noted several social media complaints from Texas voters who alleged that when they voted a straight republican ticket that voting machines were switching their presidential selection to Clinton/Kaine. While most undoubtedly dismissed these reports as conspiracy theories, new official reports from Chambers County, Texas suggest that there might be some truth to the voting machine ""irregularities"". According to an NBC affiliate , polling stations in Chambers County had to enact emergency protocols yesterday and revert back to paper ballots after a ""glitch"" was discovered in the county's voting machines. 
The issue was actually discovered on Monday morning when Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne was casting her own ballot and the voter next to her noticed that one of her votes was not filled in when she reviewed her electronic ballot Hawthorne told 12News on Tuesday. 

An error in the voting machine programming by Election Systems & Software (ES&S) caused votes for one statewide court of appeals race not to be entered when a voter tried to vote straight ticket in either party according to a release from Chambers County. 

ES&S is the vendor that Chambers County contracts with to program their voting machines. 

The Texas Secretary of State's office informed Hawthorne to create emergency paper ballots to continue voting until the problem could be fixed according to the release. 
Below is the official press release from the Chambers County Clerk: 

Of course, these confirmed reports from Chambers County seem eerily similar to problems reported yesterday on social media from people who also experienced problems when voting a ""straight republican ticket."" 

The following report also surfaced in Arlington, Texas from a person who voted a straight republican ticket only to find just before submitting her ballot that her presidential choice had been switched to Clinton/Kaine . After reporting the error to polling officials, the voter was told that these errors ""had been happening."" 

This Reddit user also noted multiple reports of voting errors across the state of Texas. 

Of course, the real question is how many people submitted erroneous ballots before this ""glitch"" was caught and how many other ""software glitches"" exist in other counties around the country that will never be caught?",english,2016-10-26T21:06:43.751+03:00,zerohedge.com,US,2435,Texas County Enacts "Emergency Paper Ballots" After "Software Glitch" In Voting Machines,0,,0,1,0,0,0,bs

Gold lending by central banks to bullion banks is one of the most opaque areas of the gold market. Bank of England Asks UK Banks To Detail Their Exposure To Deutsche And Italian Banks Oct 26, 2016 2:13 PM 0 SHARES 
In what may or may not be a coincidence, just hours after Bloomberg reported that DB launched a probe into whether it ""misstated"" derivatives, moments ago the FT reported that the Bank of England is seeking details from large British banks on their current exposure to Deutsche Bank and some of the biggest Italian banks, including Monte dei Paschi , ""amid mounting market jitters over the health of Europe’s financial sector."" 
The FT notes that the request was made in recent weeks by the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority as investors sold off Deutsche and Monte dei Paschi, both of which have been the subject of scrutiny over their capital levels. Supervisors worldwide have attempted to curtail the links between large institutions since the 2008 banking crisis, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers and other big groups threatened to drag down the entire global financial system. 
While the PRA regularly speaks to banks about their exposures, particularly to any lender that might be facing difficulty, the BoE’s recent intervention is a sign of continued nervousness among regulators that the interconnectedness of Europe’s largest banks could harm otherwise healthy groups if one of the weakest links were to fall into crisis. 
Som more details: 
Normally, exposures to other financial institutions are not disclosed to regulators unless they are particularly large or as part of annual stress tests. That forced the BoE to ask for the latest snapshot of the big UK banks’ exposures to their German and Italian rivals as those groups came under market attack. Banks can be exposed to one another directly through lending or derivatives but indirect exposures — such as lending to a counterparty of a bank in trouble — also need to be considered. 

Global rules cap the amount that one bank can hold in another to 25 per cent of the first bank’s capital, while anything above 10 per cent must be disclosed to regulators. Smaller holdings are therefore harder for supervisors to spot. 

Paul Sharma, a former PRA official now a consultant at Alvarez & Marsal, said large UK banks were now able to monitor their direct exposure to troubled banks on a “near real-time” basis but that market turmoil could complicate the picture. 
The FT also writes that British regulators are particularly anxious about the impact of litigation costs on Deutsche’s already weak profitability and that large piles of non-performing loans could have a similarly corrosive impact on Italian banks . 
As we pointed out earlier, Germany’s biggest bank still faces serious doubts on whether it will need to raise billions of euros of extra capital and slash costs drastically to strengthen its balance sheet and boost profits. Among the entities rumored to provide backstop capital are various middle-eastern funds as well as rumored Chinese investors. 
Normally, similar reports of heightened regulatory scrutiny would lead to a brike selling in any named bank; however perhaps because Deutsche Bank has already been through hell and back over the past few months, this latest news will hardly come as a shock to investors. 
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank is set to announce earnings tomorrow, in which it is expected to announce a lower net loss of around €610 million, versus a massive €6 billion loss one year ago, much of which stemmed from write-downs on investment-banking and other assets. At this time last year, Deutsche Bank was kicking off its new, multi-year overhaul under Chief Executive John Cryan. This quarter's loss is expected to be largely due to another large major litigation provision ahead of a potential settlement with the DoJ. Analysts are split on precisely how much the bank will set aside, but their forecasts range from €250m to €1.5bn according to a consensus report compiled by the bank. Analysts also expect third-quarter revenues to be €7.1 billion, according to a consensus of 17 analysts' estimates compiled by the bank. That compares with €7.3 billion a year ago. 
Prolonged uncertainty around Deutsche Bank's capital position-exacerbated by the litigation questions--have fueled persistent questions about whether the lender might be forced to sell shares, shed businesses it has planned to keep, or accelerate cost-cutting plans. 
Keys to Deutsche Bank's plans for building its capital cushion include divesting its German retail-banking division called Postbank. That plan has proved more difficult than expected, and investors want to know the latest-especially if executives have changed their minds. Investors will also want to know when the bank is going to see the cash it is expecting from selling its roughly 20% stake in Chinese bank Hua Xia. The roughly $4 billion deal was announced in December 2015, but the proceeds have taken longer to arrive than executives expected. 
Meanwhile, in an attempt to cut costs, DB has undergone on a major layoff spree and, as reported yesterday, is considering paying banker bonuses in compensation other than cash.",english,2016-10-26T21:33:04.557+03:00,zerohedge.com,US,2435,Bank of England Asks UK Banks To Detail Their Exposure To Deutsche And Italian Banks,0,,0,1,273,0,273,bs

It has been a harsh week for the 8,000 refugees inhabiting the Calais ""Jungle"" camp. 
Continuing an operation which began on Monday, workers ramped up demolition of France's notorious Calais ""Jungle"" on Wednesday after fierce blazes cut through a swathe of the camp overnight, sending migrants fleeing for safety. Fabienne Buccio, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said it was ""mission accomplished"" for the demolition. 
However his assessment may have been premature as charities said many unaccompanied minors had not been processed and BBC reporters at the camp said groups of adults remained. 
Wearing hardhats and orange overalls in the morning fog, a team of around 15 workers resumed tearing down tents and makeshift shelters at the camp that has become a symbol of Europe's migrant crisis. 
As recounted by AFP reporters, a new fire threw black smoke into the sky as several dozen wood shacks smouldered on a main thoroughfare of the sprawling slum. ""Someone burned our tents. Maybe they used petrol or something, I don't know, but the fires spread fast. We had to run out in the middle of the night,"" said Arman Khan, a 17-year-old Afghan. ""I left all my things behind, I have nothing now."" 
Riot police had cordoned off the demolition area while aid workers and government officials checked that the dwellings were empty. Others carted away the debris and abandoned belongings - mattresses, multi-coloured blankets, supermarket trollies and so on - in small earth-movers. Gas canisters, sinks, refrigerators and other metal objects lay scattered across the desolate scene. 
The fires spread just hours after workers moved in Tuesday to clear the squalid camp that has been home to an estimated 6,000-8,000 migrants, many with hopes of reaching Britain. 
A local official played down the blazes, telling AFP: ""It's a tradition among communities who set fire to their homes before leaving."" Located next to the port of Calais, the Jungle has for years been a launchpad for migrants attempting to make it to Britain by sneaking onto trucks or jumping onto trains heading across the Channel. 
Since Monday, 3,242 adults have been transferred to centres around France and 772 unaccompanied minors have been moved to shipping containers converted into temporary shelters in the Jungle, the interior ministry said. The numbers represent around half the camp's estimated population before the operation began, according to official figures. 
The authorities have said those who agree to be moved can seek asylum in France. Those who refuse risk deportation. The fate of more than 1,000 unaccompanied minors is of particular concern. 
Meanwhile, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Tuesday that all those ""with proven family links in Britain"" would eventually be transferred and that London had committed to reviewing all other cases where it was ""in the child's interest"" to settle across the Channel.

However, not all are seeking to rush back. Many inhabitants of the camp attempted to break through the police line and storm back into the camp, which is being demolished by the authorities, according to RT's reporter on the ground.

A migrant child, who was among those returning to the camp, waved a cricket bat and shouted: “Jungle is not dead! Jungle is not dead!” according to the British Express newspaper. “It’s chaos with these ongoing fires and plumes of smoke [across the camp],” Harry Fear reported from the scene. 
“The police line was broken by migrants wanting to enter back in,” he said, adding that it appears new fires have been set across the camp. 
According to the RT correspondent, the operation to clear Calais looks much like a failure, despite claims of its complete success by the French authorities. He said that fire brigades on site have been working “quite slowly” to put out the fires. The RT crew also noticed “uncontrolled gas canisters [at the camp’s territory], which haven’t yet been secured by the authorities,” Fear added. 
According to an unnamed regional official, the authorities will be able to shut down the processing center, which is dispersing migrants to different locations in France until the end of the day. Fires keep burning in many locations around the camp as some migrants set fire to the camp in response to government actions.

The demolition of tents and wooden structures, which the residents had used as shelter, started at the site on Tuesday. Violent clashes between the police and the inhabitants were reported, with tear gas deployed by officers. The camp was set ablaze last night by refugees displeased with the demolition.

Thousands of hopeful migrants, many of whom are now homeless, are looking to cross the English Channel to find asylum in the UK have been holed up at the camp for months. Britain, however, only agreed to take in around 1,000 migrant children from the camp who have relatives in the UK. 
On Wednesday, almost 40 councils in England refused to accept any of the child refugees evacuated from the camp.

Much was lost when the Western Roman Empire collapsed, but islands of literacy, learning and security arose despite the constant conflicts and threats of invasion. 
Once dissed as The Dark Ages, the Medieval Era is more properly viewed as a successful adaptation to the challenges of the post-Western Roman Empire era. The decline of the Western Roman Empire was the result of a constellation of challenges, including (but not limited to) massive new incursions of powerful Germanic tribes, a widening chasm between the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantium), plague, an onerous tax burden on the non-elite classes, weak leadership, the dominance of a self-serving elite (sound familiar?) and last but not least, the expansion of an unproductive rabble in Rome that had to be bribed with increasingly costly Bread and Circuses . 
In effect, The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire ran out of time and money. The Grand Strategy, successful for hundreds of years, relied heavily on persuading ""barbarian"" tribes to join the Roman system for the commercial and security benefits. This process of integration worked because it was backed by the threat of destruction by military force. 
The Empire maintained relatively modest military forces given its vast territory, but its road system and fleet enabled relatively rapid concentration of force to counter an invasion. It also maintained extensive fortifications along active borders. 
All of this required substantial tax revenues, manpower and effective leadership, not just for fortifications, the army, roads and the fleet, but to maintain the commercial and political benefits offered to ""barbarians"" who chose integration in the Empire. 
Once the military threats proliferated and the benefits of Imperial membership eroded, the Grand Strategy was unable to maintain the integrity of the Imperial borders. 
As tax revenues and the bureaucracy they supported imploded, security declined, reducing trade and communications. This unvirtuous cycle fed on itself: reduced trade led to reduced tax revenues which led to phantom legions that were still listed on the bureaucratic ledgers but which no longer had any troops. 
The collapse of the Western Empire was a process, not an event. Key organizational infrastructures that endured through the Medieval era--for example, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian Churches--gained traction in the waning centuries of the Western Empire. 
Monasteries offered islands of scholarship and literacy and in many cases offered security via fortifications. 
As trade diminished along with secure trade routes, self-reliance became the order of the day outside the borders of the Byzantine and Persian empires. 
Though political leadership shifted with the latest invasion from the steppes of Eurasia, the two branches of Christendom slowly converted many invading groups or consolidated existing Christian powers into alliances that bound together diverse groups and proto-states. 
These alliances were typically contingent and temporary, as today's ally became tomorrow's enemy, or vice versa. Despite the shifting loyalties of constant invasion and warfare, the Byzantine Empire endured and Charlemagne (and others) in Western Europe established the fractured but still effective Holy Roman Empire. 
Much was lost when the Western Roman Empire collapsed, but islands of literacy, learning and security arose despite the constant conflicts and threats of invasion. Venice offers one example of a small city securing trade routes with commercial centers that then funded a regional empire. 
The tidiness of the old Empire could not be reinstated. The adaptations were as messy and untidy as the challenges that swept in from the steppes and forests. 
So please don't diss the Dark Ages. Yes, the Roman baths, coliseums and political /social order fell into disrepair, but new ways of coping emerged that were as contingent and untidy as the era's multiple challenges. 
New modes of production and new social /political orders do not arise fully formed. They are pieced together by trial and error and numerous cycles of adaptation, innovation and failure.",english,2016-10-26T22:05:24.968+03:00,zerohedge.com,US,2435,Don't Diss The Dark Ages,0,,0,1,56,0,56,bs

After trading in a tight range for much of the summer, coiled within a $100 range around the mid-$500s, over the past several weeks bitcoin has once again started to push higher, closely tracking the decline in the Chinese Yuan as shown below. 
However, the most recent burst in bitcoin activity, which sent it surging by over $20 overnight, has little to do with any moves in the official Chinese currency, which recently rebounded modestly tracking the recent dip in the dollar, and is likely attributable to a long overdue crackdown on China's Wealth-management products, a key component of China’s ""shadow banking"" system. 
As Bloomberg reported overnight , China’s central bank is finally conducting a trial monitoring of banks’ off-balance-sheet wealth-management products under its macro-prudential assessment system. A question one should ask perhaps is why the $1.9 trillion in asset locked up with WMPs had so far been exempt from regulatory supervision. 
Just as notable, going forward the WMPs will be included in calculating broad-based credit, something we discussed last week when we showed just how vastly China is undercounting its broadest credit aggregate, Total Social Financing by ignoring shadow debt . Currently, the products aren’t included in the assessment framework, however it’s not clear when or if the People’s Bank of China will add them, Bloomberg added. 

Citigroup estimated that 13 trillion yuan ($1.9 trillion) of the products, which are a key building block in China’s shadow-banking system, could be covered. Other banks' estimates are even bigger. 
No matter the size, the extra scrutiny will certainly cool growth of the unregulated products, as China tries to rein in financial risks that could tank the economy. Adding the products to the central bank’s calculations could help to emphasize requirements for lenders to limit dangers and maintain sufficient capital. A change would mean regulators would be may be better able to “control the pace of broad-based credit supply,"" Judy Zhang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Citigroup, said in a note. WMP issuance and yields may shrink as lenders pass on extra costs to investors, she said. 
As Bank of America explained overnight, in late 2015, PBoC officially introduced its MPA framework, which expanded its focus from loans to credit in a broader sense, covering not only loans but also banks’ bond investments, equity rights and other investments, financial assets bought with re-sale agreement, and deposits with non-deposit-taking financial institutions. The MPA can make it more difficult for banks to adjust on-balance sheet assets to circumvent government’s credit control. The latest move adds banks’ off-balance sheet WMPs, i.e. those without a principal guarantee, to the mix. This, in theory, should make it more difficult for banks to move assets off balance sheet . 
Chinese households, companies and banks held a record 26.3 trillion yuan of wealth-management products as of June 30 and the China Banking Regulatory Commission has been tightening rules on WMPs since late 2014. Most of the products are non-principal guaranteed, which means they reside off banks’ balance sheets. 
The implications for th economy can be significant: 
The cornerstone of PBoC’s MPA is capital adequacy, in-line with Basel III. So it’s possible that in the long term, banks may be required to provide capital for at least some of its off-balance sheet assets, including the WMPs. As of Jun, total balance of bank WMPs reached Rmb26.3tr. Without considering future growth, the additional amount under the MPA would be some Rmb15.5tr, after deducting Rmb6.1tr products with guarantees (already on banks’ balance sheet) and Rmb4.7tr of cash and deposits. This represents about 7% of banks’ on-balance sheet assets as of June (Rmb217tr). More important, we should view the latest development in the broad context of policy tightening over shadow banking activities since early this year (related reports linked in the sidebar). 
However, the most immediate practical consideration from the increased regulatory supervision of the $1.9 trillion in related product is that these funds, many of which are of highly suspect origins, will seek to shift away from the heightened scrutiny and find alternative venues. Which may explain the latest jump in bitcoin as a modest portion of the funds locked up wealth-management products may have found itself into the digital currency, promptly sending it higher by nearly 5%. Should the crackdown on WMPs persist, it may be just the catalyst to push bitcoin above its recent multi-year highs just why of $800 hit earlier this summer.",english,2016-10-26T22:55:01.492+03:00,zerohedge.com,US,2435,Bitcoin Soars As China Launches Crackdown On Wealth-Management Products,0,,0,1,172,0,172,bs

Project Veritas has just released Part IV of it's multi-part series exposing numerous scandals surrounding the DNC and the Clinton campaign, including efforts to incite violence at Trump rallies and, at least what seems to be, illegal coordination between the DNC, Hillary For America and various Super PACs. 
Part IV focuses on a $20,000 foreign donation made by an undercover Project Veritas journalist to Americans United for Change (AUFC). Ironically, shortly after the $20k donation wire was released, the contributor's ""niece"" was offered an internship with Creamer's firm, Democracy Partners. 
In the effort to prove the credibility of the undercover donor featured in the videos and to keep the investigation going, Project Veritas Action made the decision to donate twenty thousand dollars to Robert Creamer’s effort. Project Veritas Action had determined that the benefit of this investigation outweighed the cost. And it did. 

“First thing, like I said, thank you for the proposal. And I’d like to get the $20,000 across to you. The second call I’m going to make here is to my money guy and he’s going to get in touch with you and auto wire the funds to you,” said the PVA journalist. 

Creamer told the PVA journalist to send the money to Americans United for Change. Shortly after the money was released, the “donors” “niece” - another Project Veritas Action journalist - was offered an internship with Creamer. 

In an effort to see how far Creamer would go with the promise of more money, another Project Veritas journalist posing as the donor’s money liaison requested a meeting with Creamer. During that meeting, Creamer spoke about connections he had with Obama and Clinton. 
AUFC President, Brad Woodhouse, subsequently returned the money, after Project Veritas started to release their undercover videos, citing ""concerns that it might have been an illegal foreign donation."" Oddly, Woodhouse was not terribly concerned about the ""legality"" of the donation when he chose to accept it a month prior. 
In an unexpected twist, AUFC president Brad Woodhouse, the recipient of the $20,000, heard that Project Veritas Action was releasing undercover videos exposing AUFC’s activities. He told a journalist that AUFC was going to return the twenty thousand dollars. He said it was because they were concerned that it might have been an illegal foreign donation. Project Veritas Action was pleased but wondered why that hadn’t been a problem for the month that they had the money. 

While the latest video focuses on the "" $20,000 illegal foreign contribution"" from an undercover Project Veritas journalist , the following comments from Robert Creamer were also rather intriguing in light of recent White House efforts to vehemently deny any connections between he and President Obama. 
""Oh Barack Obama's was the best campaign in the history of American politics, I mean the second one, I mean the first was good too. I was a consultant to both, the second one, was everything hit on every level and every aspect. 

He's a pro. I've known the President since he was a community organizer in Chicago . 

I was just at and event with him in Chicago actually, on Friday last . He is just as good as ever. I do a lot of work with the White House on their issues. Helping to run issued campaigns that they have been involved in. I mean, for immigration reform for the...the health care bill...trying to make America more like Britain when it comes to gun violence issues.""

The most important and formidable group within those backing Clinton belong to the upper echelon of society: Wall Street’s movers and shakers, big business, the top of the political pyramid and the servants and profiteers of the public sector. In one word: the establishment. 
Clinton’s support base includes therefore practically everyone who profits from government regulations and government corruption – they have everything to lose if Hillary doesn’t win. It is the same group that advocates and leads the political correctness movement ; they are those state-bred and fed intellectuals who poison the university campus and mass media circus with their belief that they can transform the U.S. into a “utopia”. 
The candidate anointed by the Deep State 
In reality, this “utopia” will be created through intense centralization, endless wars and plundering, only to create a totalitarian government where the political elite enforces its will and instructs the public on how to live a happy life, which only benefits the top strata of society that designed it in the first place. Years ago, Jewish American philosopher Hannah Arendt summarized the toxic impact of political correctness as follows: 
“There is no thought process without freedom. To deprive man of his liberty is to deprive him of his own ideas, and if one is not allowed to think, only subjugation and slavery remain.” 
This can only be achieved through a strong foothold on the centralized state and its propaganda engine, the mass media, operating under the doctrine of Edward Bernays, the father of propaganda, better known as public relations. 
Then there’s the other extreme of Clinton’s supporters: the artificially created underprivileged minorities. These groups have come to depend on the state for support and protection, which has also made it easy for the state to indoctrinate them and reset their mindset to its advantage. 
Those are the people who have fallen in the trap of thinking that only the state can provide them with what they need for a good life, when in reality it only disempowered them. The globalist Clinton herself accuses Trump of “populism”, casting “nationalism” in a negative light, but she is actually the one promising free lunches for everyone: lenient immigration laws, higher minimum wages, universal healthcare, etc. 
Clinton also preaches against income inequality and condemns Wall Street greed in her speeches, while her campaign cashes in from Wall Street’s finest: JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. 
Under those circumstances… what can you possibly do? Ms. Clinton’s top five donors are Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, DLA Piper, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley. Somehow we don’t think Wall Street has reason to fear her much. Trump – the Greatest Politically Incorrect Shock in Decades? 
Whenever people are forced by the government to accept and pay for things they do not want, the outcome is discontent and opposition, typically suppressed and downplayed by the mainstream media in accordance with the state’s agenda of political correctness. This further escalates the situation and things often take unpleasant turns, including the fostering of racist and bigoted subsections that we see within the Trump voting base. 
But they are not the majority, not by long shot! One might get this impression, because the mainstream media tend to focus exclusively on this sub-set of supporters through footage and interviews at Trump rallies, because they are considered “interesting” material; after all, they say outrageously horrible things and are therefore great for TV sensationalism. 
What does Donald Trump stand for? From my perspective, for anything and everything! He stands for everyone who is sick and tired of the current system and the political elite who have grown out of touch with ordinary American citizens. You will find them among the working class, small business owners, and the segment of society that used to be known as the middle class before the crisis; they all harbor grievances against the establishment. 
There have been a few halfhearted attempts to paint Trump as part of the establishment because he is rich and has always hobnobbed with the elite as a result of his social status, but they have generally failed. For one thing, he is not a politician. For another thing, his consistent political incorrectness and the list of his political enemies (which includes many Republican Deep State zombies) has simply made it impossible to lump him with the establishment. 

These are people who understand that the slogan “the Union and the Constitution forever” has been under attack and downgraded to nothing more than an empty phrase by the power elite and the Deep State. We see first hand how the Patriot Act directly violates not only the first amendment’s guarantee of free speech, but also the fourth and fifth amendments, thereby tearing apart the very foundation of a country once based on respect for civil liberties. 
There is no doubt that the second amendment will be crushed under Clinton as well, “regulating to extinction” the natural right to self-defense and personal sovereignty. We must never forget that we are born with inherent rights, that can neither be granted nor taken away from us by the State. As Judge Napolitano once put it: 
“Natural law teaches that our freedoms are pre-political and come from our humanity and not from the government. As our humanity is ultimately divine in origin, the government, even by majority vote, cannot morally take natural rights away from us. 

A natural right is an area of individual human behavior – like thought, speech, worship, travel, self-defense, privacy, ownership and use of property, consensual personal intimacy – immune from government interference and for the exercise of which we don’t need the government’s permission.” 
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face to face in the last of three presidential debates under the banner of “The Union And The Constitution Forever” 

Even though polls suggest that Trump is trailing nationally, they probably underestimate exactly how big the Trump wave is, and it is significant: between 74% and 83% of Republicans said they will support him (according to polls conducted between Oct 9 th -11 th ). But there is also the silent majority that has been present at his rallies. This silent majority does not necessarily consist of Trump fans, but they do not want to see the country falling into the abyss of state centralization and political correctness. A sign often seen at Trump rallies these days – which continue to attract lots of people. Only recently, 20,000 deplorables came to see Trump at a rally in Tampa, while Hillary Clinton’s running mate Tim Kaine motivated a grand total of 50 people to come and hear him speak in West Palm Beach (reportedly they weren’t particularly enthusiastic; we don’t know how many of the 50 were from the press). 

They want to discontinue the economic system that has taken them from bad to worse – they are the American version of the European anti-establishment movement. They are well aware of Trump’s coarse character and crude remarks, but feel they can overlook that, for the sake of his main strategic advantage: Trump’s promise that he does not want America to be controlled by the establishment anymore. 
A Tale of Two Hatreds 
“Politics is like sausage being made. It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be. But if everybody’s watching… then people get a little nervous, to say the least. So, you need both a public and a private position.” Hillary Clinton, National Multi-Housing Council, April 2013 
One key reason behind the peoples’ hostility towards Clinton is that she personally embodies the hypocrisy and the hubris of the U.S. federal government itself: a government that maims and kills millions with its war on terror, it arms and supports murderous regimes and ideological fanatics and it is known to deploy chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. And yet, it somehow pretends to hold the moral high ground and lectures others on human rights. 
Just as America is an “exceptional” country, for which normal standards don’t apply, Clinton is its “exceptional” candidate. She accuses her opponent of populism, when her own platform is entirely based on crowd-pleasing promises. 
She calls Trump’s policies fascistic while her own would put the final nail on the coffin of free speech. She claims to stand up for the little guy, while she funds her campaign with Wall Street money. She positions herself as the defender of minorities’ and women’s rights, while her Foundation accepts donations from the most oppressive regimes on the planet. 
Defending the rights of women isn’t cheap, so obviously one can’t be too picky and choosy about one’s donors. 

At the same time, the American electorate also feels hostility for Trump; that hate is not equivalent though, as few would argue he is trying to hide who he is. The reason why so many dislike him is very different, and it has to do with the identity he projects. He is the ultimate “anti-intellectual”. 
Of course the term “intellectual” is quite broad these days, and many intellectuals dislike Trump solely because of what it would say about who they are (in the eyes of their like-minded peers). But these people share a common denominator: they are educated beyond their intelligence and critically depend on repeating what other “intellectual” people say, as they feel (consciously or not) their ignorance would be exposed if they dared to express an original idea. 
Trump’s world, according to a recent NYT cartoon. The statist intelligentsia certainly feels threatened by Trump. 
The Day After: The Legacy of a Bitter Campaign Year 
Unfortunately, whoever wins, the nation will pay a price for this “divide and conquer” rhetoric. Americans today are too polarized and the tensions that are brewing in the background will not just go away the day after the election: racial and social divisions, as well as the split caused by the choice between a planned vs. a free market economy, a big or a small government. 
Under Trump, we can only hope that America will be given time to heal and to overcome these divisions. Free speech is key: Society can only heal if it returns to a culture of debate with a willingness to agree to disagree. 
From what we know from modern American history, we shouldn’t be surprised that the financial markets appear to prefer Hillary over Trump. Wall Street, the bankers and the military industrial complex are expected to continue to thrive under President Clinton. The establishment will live on. Right now the establishment is seemingly pushing for war against Russia and Clinton is undeniably on board with this aggressive narrative. 
And then we have Trump, who is certainly far from perfect. His objectification of women, his comments about Muslims and minorities, his crass demeanor: All these have made it very hard for him to find support for his genuine policy points. Will the “silent majority” be able to actually swing the election for Trump? Although the mainstream media seem to be of one mind regarding the election outcome, we certainly wouldn’t rule it out. If ever there was a candidate provoking the “Bradley effect” in polls, it is surely Trump. Moreover, thanks to Wikileaks it is by now public knowledge that the polls are indeed rigged . Readers may recall that we have expressed doubts about the accuracy of poll sampling methods already some time ago. 

Even if the actual net effect of his policies were to benefit women, he won’t get them on his side by calling them pigs – there is a difference between free speech and just being plain rude, uncivil and vulgar. We may disagree with his infamous “wall” with Mexico and demands for “a new budget to rebuild our depleted military” (which makes him no different from Clinton). But he is an outsider, a businessman, and most importantly, a crack in system! 
He challenges the status quo, and that’s why the status quo attacks him, by trying to ridicule both him and his voters, by painting them as extremists, or as ignorant and racist. The question is, why don’t we just let Trump be Trump? 
As he himself said: “It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to!” . Consider the boldness of this statement – regardless of whether one agrees with him, he stands confidently for his principles and ideas, even against his own party’s leaders (many of which have withdrawn their support). This is a clear projection of power and independence; it says that no one can dictate their demands to him. It says that he is unafraid to speak his mind. 
I say, we should trust his followers. It seems clear that most Trump voters are striving to defend the essence of the constitution and its original intent – to be the basis of a free society. And for me as a believer in civil rights and sovereignty, this is enough to give him or let me rather say, his voters, the benefit of the doubt.",english,2016-10-26T23:06:05.104+03:00,zerohedge.com,US,2435,Love Him Or Hate Him: Trump Is The Revolution Against The Establishment,0,,0,1,280,0,280,bs

when i awoke this morning the Dow Jones Propaganda Index was down 72 points…then in a matter of only a few minutes it inexplicably reverse ramped almost 100 points to turn positive… 
it was then that i decided to scour the Lamestream media, Alt-Media, and lastly ZeroHedge headlines to uncover what could be behind such a preposterous, absolutely fraudulent spike across all the Fraud indices… 
however before i could conclude my inquiry the DJPI spiked another 50 plus points to recapture the all important, CON fidence inspiring 18,200 mark coincidentally beginning exactly in the last 30 minutes of “trading” in the EuroPeon cesspool of fraud and manipulation - Londone… 
it was then that i realized that what had occurred was the same bullshit i’ve witnessed for the last 5-7 years running…that being that the Fraud Markets ramped on ABSOLUTLEY NO GENUINE POSITIVE MACRO-ECONOMIC, GEO-POLITICAL NEWS OR DATA WHATSOFUCKINGEVER… 
at that moment , roughly 9:14 am, i realized that for todays ""Fraud Markets Wrap” to be posted latter in the day, i could simply “cut & paste“ from previous commentaries regarding what the rest of the day would portend because as i and many others have learned - “When the same bullshit happens every day there’s no need to type…just cut and paste…” - Kaiser Sousa - 
so thats precisely what i did… ""then, of course yet again all of the U.S. Fraud Indices entered into the sideways shuffle, ridiculous narrow “trading” pattern you all now as “suspended levitation” for the bulk of the day…” - Kaiser Sousa - from every day the last 2 years. http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia 
then in the famous last 2 hours of “trading”, and despite the “markets” coughing up the phony reversal implemented by “you know who”,they nonetheless fought to the death to hold on to those “green shoots” with “investors” piling into such noted bail weathers like , BOEING, NIKE, GE, and DISNEY pushing the DJPI back above the 18,200 mark… proving that the recovery in the land of the “exceptional’s” continues to shower its’ waiters, bartenders, fast food servers, and interest income starved senior citizens with generational wealth and prosperity for all… 
lastly, as for the blatant attempts to hold the phony paper prices of Gold & Silver within ridiculous “trading ranges” while the global financial and monetary system crumbles before “eyes that dare to see” alike every fiat currency (WITHOUT EXCEPTION!!) has throughout history - lets just say this…how much more obvious can the Fed, Exchange Stabilization Fund, ThreadNeddle St. inbreeds, and Scum St. flunkies make it for you

There was a sudden burst of confusion heading into today's Tesla earnings. As Bloomberg reported , a change in the way Tesla Motors Inc. will report quarterly results after today’s market close has created a bit of a last-minute headache for analysts, with earnings estimates varying widely. The electric-car maker is phasing out most of the non-GAAP adjustments it’s traditionally made, including ones for resale value guarantees or vehicles leased through banking partners. Starting today, when the company discusses third-quarter adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share, it plans to exclude only stock-based compensation. 
The SEC in recent months has raised concern that public companies may be straying too far too often from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Though Tesla has telegraphed its plan for weeks, many analysts are only now revising forecast models and some are sitting out the guessing game entirely this time. That means it may be challenging to draw firm conclusions about whether Tesla missed or beat Wall Street expectations - giving added importance to what Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says on a follow-up conference call about cash or production plans. 
So heading into today's earnings, the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts stands at an adjusted loss of 54 cents a share, based on seven forecasts that have comparable methodologies that the firms say take the new practice into account. While all seven of those projected a loss, there are others who say the company may post a profit. 
Well, those who expected a profit got just that, because momnets ago Tesla not only reported revenue of $2.3 billion, far higher than the $1.9 billion expected, but also reported its first quarterly profit of $74 cents, smashing consensus estimate of a 54 cent loss. 
Since there will be much confusion over how these numbers make any sense, here is what the company said: 
Starting this quarter, our financial releases no longer include the non-GAAP revenue disclosures that we historically provided. To simplify our financial reporting, we add back non-cash stock-based compensation (SBC) to calculate non-GAAP results. Consistent with previous quarters, non-GAAP automotive gross margin will also exclude ZEV credit sales. 

Total Q3 GAAP revenue was $2.30 billion, up 145% from Q3 2015, while total Q3 gross margin was 27.7%, compared to 21.6% in Q2. 

Total automotive revenue was $2.15 billion on a GAAP basis, up 152% from Q3 2015. Our final Q3 delivery count was 24,821, over 300 more than the estimated delivery count we shared on October 2nd. Deliveries increased 114% from the third quarter of 2015, and was comprised of 16,047 Model S and 8,774 Model X vehicles. In addition, 5,065 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These vehicles will be delivered in Q4. 

Our Q3 GAAP net income was $22 million, or $0.14 per share on 157 million diluted shares, while our non-GAAP net income was $111 million, or $0.71 per share on a diluted basis, after adding back $90 million of SBC. Both figures include an $0.08 per share loss of other expense, net, primarily related to foreign currency transactions and the conversion of most of our 2018 convertible notes. 
Confused? So are we, and sadly charting the results does not help: 

And here are the company's GAAP revenues: 

Alas, even looking at the company's cash flow does not provide much apples to apples color. Here's why: 
We hope that Elon Musk can provide some clarity on just what is going on here, because Wall Street has no idea. 
* * * 
Going back to its core business, said that its final Q3 delivery count was 24,821, over 300 more than the estimated delivery count we shared on October 2nd. "" Deliveries increased 114% from the third quarter of 2015, and was comprised of 16,047 Model S and 8,774 Model X vehicles. In addition, 5,065 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter. These vehicles will be delivered in Q4."" 
It added the following: 
During the quarter, we opened 17 new stores and service centers to increase our customer support network to 250 locations globally. We believe new product variants such as the P100DL, additional Model X seating variants, new product capabilities such as Enhanced Autopilot and hardware for Full Self-Driving Capability, Autopilot 8.0 software, and new store and service center openings should continue to drive strong vehicle order growth. 
The company also said that it had ""achieved record production levels in Q3, rising to 25,185 vehicles for an increase of 37% from Q2 and an increase of 92% from Q3 last year"" 
TSLA said 4Q deliveries were “just over” 25k, had 3Q deliveries of 24.5k, forecast 2H deliveries of 50k. The company also said that the Model 3 remains on plan for volume deliveries in second half of 2017. Here is the full outlook: 
We maintain our guidance of 50,000 new vehicle deliveries for the second half of 2016, with a Q4 plan of just over 25,000 deliveries, despite the challenges of winter weather and the holiday season. We expect about 30% to 35% of these deliveries to be accounted for as leases for revenue recognition purposes. 

As previously provided in our second quarter update, we guided a 2 to 3 percentage points improvement in automotive gross margin on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis by the end of 2016. Automotive gross margin on a non-GAAP basis excludes ZEV credits and SBC. We are on track to meet this guidance. 

We also guided in our second quarter update that full year 2016 operating expenses, both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, would grow approximately 30% from 2015. We are also on track to meet this guidance. 

We now expect our capital expenditures in 2016 will be approximately $1.8 billion as we continue to focus on capital efficiency. Capital expenditures for the past three quarters totaled $759 million.

Hillary Clinton wants to start an air war with Russia. Let’s be clear: That’s what a no-fly zone means. It is tantamount to a declaration of war against Russia. 

*** 

Clearly the Democrats are incredibly embarrassed about the nature of these [email] revelations, and they’ve created a smokescreen here to try and distract from that. But that smokescreen is pushing us to the brink of warfare with Russia now, where you have the U.S. head of defense, Ashton Carter, talking about nuclear war. We just did a dry run dropping fake nuclear bombs over Nevada. This is really dangerous stuff; this is not pretend. So we need to take a deep breath here, we need to step back and stop beating the war drums. In this context, Hillary Clinton is talking about starting an air war with Russia. Which could slide—you know, we’re on the verge of nuclear war right now. 

*** 

The most likely nuclear threat right now is with Russia. There’s no doubt about that. When you have Mikhail Gorbachev, who was the prime minister of the Soviet Union during the Cold War, saying that the threat of nuclear war is hotter now than it has ever been in all of history, you’ve got to take that pretty seriously. And when you have Hillary Clinton then beating the war drums against Russia, and essentially saying that if she’s elected that we will declare war on Russia—because that’s what a no-fly zone over Syria amounts to. Shooting down Russian warplanes. 

*** 

Hillary Clinton is a disastrous nuclear threat right now in a context where we’re already off-the-charts in the risk of nuclear war. She has stated in this context that she’s essentially opening up a battlefront with Russia. So to my mind, this emerges as the clearest and most present danger. 
Prominent liberal economist Jeffrey Sachs writes in the Huffington Post, in an essay bannered “ Hillary Is the Candidate of the War Machine “: 
It is often believed that the Republicans are the neocons and the Democrats act as restraints on the warmongering. This is not correct. Both parties are divided between neocon hawks and cautious realists who don’t want the US in unending war. Hillary is a staunch neocon whose record of favoring American war adventures explains much of our current security danger. 

Just as the last Clinton presidency set the stage for financial collapse, it also set the stage for unending war. On October 31, 1998 President Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act that made it official US policy to support “regime change” in Iraq. 
It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime. 
Thus were laid the foundations for the Iraq War in 2003. 

Of course, by 2003, Hillary was a Senator and a staunch supporter of the Iraq War, which has cost the US trillions of dollars, thousands of lives, and done more to create ISIS and Middle East instability than any other single decision of modern foreign policy. In defending her vote, Hillary parroted the phony propaganda of the CIA: 
“In the four years since the inspectors left, intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members…“ 
After the Iraq Liberation Act came the 1999 Kosovo War, in which Bill Clinton called in NATO to bomb Belgrade, in the heart of Europe, and unleashing another decade of unrest in the Balkans. Hillary, traveling in Africa, called Bill: “I urged him to bomb,” she told reporter Lucinda Frank. 

Hillary’s record as Secretary of State is among the most militaristic, and disastrous, of modern US history . Some experience. Hilary was a staunch defender of the military-industrial-intelligence complex at every turn, helping to spread the Iraq mayhem over a swath of violence that now stretches from Mali to Afghanistan. Two disasters loom largest: Libya and Syria. 

Hillary has been much attacked for the deaths of US diplomats in Benghazi, but her tireless promotion of the overthrow Muammar Qaddafi by NATO bombing is the far graver disaster. Hillary strongly promoted NATO-led regime change in Libya, not only in violation of international law but counter to the most basic good judgment. After the NATO bombing, Libya descended into civil war while the paramilitaries and unsecured arms stashes in Libya quickly spread west across the African Sahel and east to Syria. The Libyan disaster has spawned war in Mali, fed weapons to Boko Haram in Nigeria, and fueled ISIS in Syria and Iraq. In the meantime, Hillary found it hilarious to declare of Qaddafi: “We came, we saw, he died.” 

Perhaps the crowning disaster of this long list of disasters has been Hillary’s relentless promotion of CIA-led regime change in Syria. Once again Hillary bought into the CIA propaganda that regime change to remove Bashir al-Assad would be quick, costless, and surely successful. In August 2011, Hillary led the US into disaster with her declaration Assad must “get out of the way,” backed by secret CIA operations. 

Five years later, no place on the planet is more ravaged by unending war, and no place poses a great threat to US security. More than 10 million Syrians are displaced, and the refugees are drowning in the Mediterranean or undermining the political stability of Greece, Turkey, and the European Union. Into the chaos created by the secret CIA-Saudi operations to overthrow Assad, ISIS has filled the vacuum, and has used Syria as the base for worldwide terrorist attacks. 

The list of her incompetence and warmongering goes on. Hillary’s support at every turn for NATO expansion, including even into Ukraine and Georgia against all common sense, was a trip wire that violated the post-Cold War settlement in Europe in 1991 and that led to Russia’s violent counter-reactions in both Georgia and Ukraine. As Senator in 2008, Hilary co-sponsored 2008-SR439 , to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO. As Secretary of State, she then presided over the restart of the Cold War with Russia. 

It is hard to know the roots of this record of disaster. Is it chronically bad judgment? Is it her preternatural faith in the lying machine of the CIA? 
Is it a repeated attempt to show that as a Democrat she would be more hawkish than the Republicans? Is it to satisfy her hardline campaign financiers? Who knows? Maybe it’s all of the above. But whatever the reasons, hers is a record of disaster. Perhaps more than any other person, Hillary can lay claim to having stoked the violence that stretches from West Africa to Central Asia and that threatens US security . 
Jakob Augstein notes in Der Spiegel: 
Trump would probably be the better choice in the question of war and peace than Clinton. 

Clinton has expressly expressed the wish to establish a flight ban on Syria, or parts of it. *** In truth, it would be an act of war. The risks are unpredictable. Above all, the risk of a military conflict with Russia. 

*** 
The highest soldier of the United States of America, General Joseph Dunford, President of the United States General Staff of the United States Forces, is certain. To control the entire airspace over Syria would mean war with Syria and Russia. Dunford’s predecessor in office estimated a few years ago that an effective flight bomb over Syria would involve the use of 70,000 soldiers and a monthly cost of $ 1 billion. 
But the bottom line is Clinton’s proven historical track record … she’s at least partly responsible for war after catastrophic war and coup after disastrous coup in Libya, Syria, Kosovo, Haiti, Honduras and other countries around the world. 
Trump might speak in a crude, knee-jerk manner … but Clinton is probably more likely to actually get us into war.",english,2016-10-26T23:53:49.879+03:00,zerohedge.com,US,2435,Fact Check: Trump Is Right that Clinton Might Cause WW3,0,,0,1,333,0,333,bs
